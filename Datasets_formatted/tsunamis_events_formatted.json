(reference #79)\r\n</p><p>Regarding the 869 Tohoku-oki (Jogan) earthquake, a Japanese history book, Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku (A chronicle of Japan), records &#34;On the 26th of the 5th month of the Japanese calendar (July 9, 869), a large earthquake occurred in the province of Mutsu (divided since into the five provinces of Iwaki, Iwashiro, Rikuzen, Rikutyu and Mutsu). The sky was illuminated like day-time. A little later, people, panic-stricken by the violent trembling, were lying on the ground; some were buried under fallen houses and others inside wide-opened ground fissures, while horses and cows desperately ran about and trampled each other. A number of castles, towers, and other tall structures collapsed. Then roarings like thunder were heard towards the sea. The sea soon rushed into the villages and towns, over-whelming a few hundred miles of land along the coast. There was scarcely any time for escape, though there were boats and the high ground just before them. In this way about 1000 people were killed. Hundreds of hamlets and villages were left in ruins.&#34; (Imamura, 1934). This earthquake is suggested to be one of the predecessors of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (e.g., Sawai et al., 2015). The magnitude and source region of the 869 earthquake were re-evaluated (e.g., Sugawara et al., 2012; Namegaya and Satake, 2014) using the insights obtained from the 2011 tsunami.

The port of Callao suffered most of all from this catastrophe. Like Lima, Callao consisted mostly of single-storey houses on a low-terrace, whose height was no greater than 3 m (9-10 feet) above the high water mark. The town was enclosed by a fortress wall, whose base was sometimes washed by the strong ocean tides. Normally, the water level at Callao rises 1.4 m (4-5 feet). Up to 5000 persons lived in the town. Callao was damaged by the earthquake to the same degree as Lima. Approximately one half hour after the earthquake, the ocean &#34;swelled&#34;, rose approximately 10 m, smashed the city wall and inundated the city. When the water receded the majority of houses and other buildings were dislodged from their foundations and washed away. A sizeable portion of the city wall, including the gate, had been carried away by the water. Almost the entire population of the town perished in this disaster. Since the water advanced 4 km inland, it overtook even those who had tried to flee to Lima. Only about 200 persons managed to save themselves by clasping onto wooden objects which were being tossed about between the shore area and the island of San Lorenzo, a distance of more than 8 km away. (reference #415)</p><p>In Callao 6000 people were killed by the tsunami and 19 ships including warships were destroyed. (reference #1102)</p><p>The city of Callao was destroyed by two waves, one of which was 80 feet high. All the ships in the harbor were either destroyed or washed ashore. Destructive waves also reported from Cavallos, Cuanape, Changay, and Guara. (reference #39)</p><p>&#34;The Lima wave finished the destruction of Callao already begun by the earthquake. The sea retired slowly and returned with a roar. It swept everything before it. There were 23 ships in port mostly crushed and sunk, but the largest were carried beyond the walls of the city, four vessels, and left in the fields.&#34; (reference #3903)</p><p><i>Note: Ref#12938 discusses the claims of the tsunami affecting the island of Tenerife (Spain) in the Atlantic are highly questionable.</i></p>",

Buencuchillo, 0.S.A., an eye-witness, since he was at the\r\ntime parish-priest of Sala. During the night of that day the top of the mountain burst out with tremendous force from the same crater which since ancient times used to emit fire and rocks. The course of events was this: <p>\r\n...I noticed that also from the water there arose enormous columns of sand and ashes, which ascended in the shape of pyramids to marvelous heights and then fell back into the lake like illuminated fountains.</p><p>Some of the pyramids surged toward north, others toward east, the sight lasting until 9 o&#39;clock of the morning. At the latter hour there was felt a furious earthquake which left nothing moveable in\r\nits place within the convento. This forced me to flee to higher ground, especially as I noticed that some of the horrid pyramids shooting forth from the water were coming toward the town and place where we were. When they reached that part of the lake&#39;s shore which was known as &#34;tierra destruida&#34; [waste land?], they ruined that tract entirely, and with a second earthquake, not less fierce than the one\r\nshortly preceding, it sank into the lake. To this very day, the branches of the trees buried beneath the water can be seen from the distance. </p><p>During these terrible convulsions of the earth fissures opened in the ground amid horrifying roars, said fissures extending from the northern and northeastern beach of the lake as far as the neighborhood of the town of Calamba. Here as well as elsewhere, the whole shore of Lake Bombon has been disturbed. The entire territory of Sala and part of that of Tanauan have been rendered practically uninhabitable-the water courses have been altered, former springs have ceased to flow and new ones made their appearance, the whole country is traversed by fissures, and extensive subsidences have occurred in many places. </p><p>Sala and its surroundings to the northeast of the lake, as well as, a portion of the territory of Tanauan, which is north of it, were so thoroughly ruined and, consequently, depopulated that within the same year, 1749, the former was united with the latter town.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2340)\r\n</p><p>[...]the origin of the waves observed during the 1749 eruption remains unclear. This violent phreatomagmatic eruption (VEI 4) lasted three months and severely impacted the northern and northeastern shores of the lake (Delos Reyes et al. 2018). One earthquake led to land subsidence in the northeastern part of the caldera (near Tanauan). Explosions were located in the main crater of Taal Island (Fig. 1), with a possible extension to coastal or sublacustrine vents near the northeastern point of the island. (reference#12533)</p>",

There was a destructive earthquake on the southwest of the Philippine Islands, with a maximum intensity of VIII (IX Rossi-Forel). \r\n</p><p>The steamship &#34;Brutus&#34;, situated near Zamboanga, felt a strong seaquake. Waves arose, moving to the east and breaking on shore near Zamboanga about 10 minutes later.\r\n</p><p>At Zamboanga, about 15:00 (local time), an earthquake recurred with the same force as the preceding one.\r\nThen a phenomenon occurred which caused great panic. The sea level fell 5 m, and then rose and fell with great speed. After several such oscillations in level, sea waves began to flood the city, although they did not advance further than the first few homes. The water picked up proas riding off shore and left them high and dry. According to eyewitnesses, the greatest oscillations in level were observed from 15:00 to 16:00, and at 16:00, the second of the strongest waves arrived. The phenomenon lasted a little less than 2 hours.\r\n</p><p>At Isabela, about half an hour after the earthquake, water burst with a roar into the northeastern passage leading to the port. The enormous waves moving from the west washed away everything on shore; the sea level rose at least 7 m above the usual mark. The sea rose and fell more than 30 times, and one of the waves was considerably larger than the others. The waves broke on shore with such force that they easily rolled building timber 6 m long and pieces of masonry. A grocery store was washed away, 25 homes were destroyed, and the gunboat General Laso was imperiled.\r\n</p><p>There were victims on the farms of the Moro tribe: at Panigayan, two injured: at Balauan, five dead, six injured; at Labotan, three dead, six injured; at Matiban, five dead, homes destroyed; eight homes were washed away at Tagu.\r\n</p><p>An eyewitness on a boat riding at anchor in Sibuguey Bay, related that the water raised the boat together with its two anchors several times and the ship was in great danger.\r\n</p><p>At Dapitan Port, the sea rose 2 m at the head of the bay.\r\n</p><p>At Negros Island, at noon a boat was crossing the bay; its movements were almost totally paralyzed by the waves.\r\n</p><p>On Jolo Island, 15 minutes after the earthquake, the sea began to rise and fall at 15 minute intervals, retreating 200-250 m from shore. The maximum height of rise of water was 1 m. The rough sea calmed by 21:30 (L.T.).\r\n</p><p>On Siau Island, Indonesia, the first drop in level was observed 1.5 hours after the earthquake. In 1/2 hour, the water retreated far beyond the ebb tide mark. Then it returned, reaching the flood tide mark in a few minutes. </p><p>Tsunami reports also came from the north coast of Calimantan island (Kudat region) and from the eastern shore of Sumatra Island.\r\n</p><p>Between Labuan Island and the coast of Calimantan Island, where the depth of the water had been 6 m, a new little island quietly rose out of the water after 13:00 on the 21st. The island was made up of clay and pebbles and was 200 m long, 150 m wide, and 20 m high. Its surface gave off hot gases and there was  a strong petroleum smell. It is possible that the island was built up by the tsunami waves; on the other hand, the island could have also been the result of an underwater mud eruption.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1072:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>A tsunami claimed claimed hundreds of victims on the western shores of Basilan. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1058:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>100 victims due to the tsunami.</p>",

A tsunami, which did not do great damage, was observed on the coast of Hokkaido Island and the Sanriku coast after the earthquake. The limited damage is partly explained by the fact that the tsunami coincided with the ebb tide phase. The protective works built after the Chilean tsunami of 1960 also played a large role. The waves had a height of 1-2 m on the south coast of Hokkaido Island, and 2-5 m in the regions of Tokachi and Hidaka. The tsunami also reached a height of 5 m in places on the Sanriku coast.\r\n</p><p>The tsunami was observed by tide gauges in Japan and throughout the Pacific Basin in Mexico, Russia, the Marshall Islands, Alaska, California, and Hawaii. \r\n</p><p>As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, 52 people died and 329 people were injured; 676 homes were completely destroyed and 2,994 homes were half destroyed; 13 homes burned down and 529 homes were flooded; 97 ships were washed away and 30 were sunk. In addition, roads, bridges and protective dikes were destroyed. The total damage was estimated at least at 130 million dollars. \r\n</p><p>The mean displacement of the surface of the sea at the source has been estimated by Abe at &#43;82 cm in the zone of elevations, and -20 cm in the the zone of subsidences. Aida estimated the maximal initial rise of water at 5 m, the drop at 2 m, and the energy of the tsunami at 4 X 10<sup>20</sup> ergs. The maximum radiation of the tsunami, according to his calculations, was directed along the minor axis of the source, while more long-period oscillations radiated out along the major axis. \r\n</p><p>View a calculated <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu_travel_time.shtml#Honshu1968\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tsunami-travel-time map</a>.</p>",

There were 140 people\r\ninjured in Japan, including one woman whose car plunged off a collapsed bridge and one man who died of a heart attack. The earthquake generated a tsunami with a height of 4.5-6.0 m at the southern part of Dimitrova Bay, Shikotan Island and 3.0-7.1 meters at Tserkovnaya Bay indicating multiple\r\nwaves in the tsunami. Evidence of four separate runup heights also indicates a multiple wave attack.\r\n<p>On the west side of the island the height at Malo-kurilskaya was one to two meters. The tide gage\r\nindicated a subsidence of 53 cm. Eyewitnesses reported the initial wave to be a rise as was confirmed by the marigrams that also showed periods of about 20 minutes. Elsewhere on the island the heights were measured from <b>8.5 meters at Tserkovnaya Bay</b> to 2.6 meters. On Kunashiri Island\r\nthe maximum height was surveyed at 5.3 meters at Petrova Point. On Iturup Island the maximum height was 3.4 meters and on Polonsky Island the maximum height was 4 meters.\r\n</p><p>At Yuzhno-Kurilsk the heights ranged from 2.5-3.0 meters. In the older part of the town, waves penetrated 200 to 300 meters on the gentle, sloping beach damaging all houses. The wave penetrated 500 meters along the river destroying two bridges and washing away two homes dragging another 300 meters. All moorings were destroyed and two 300-ton fishing boats, five pontoons, and several motorboats were thrown on dry land. None of the fatalities were due to the tsunami as the maximum heights were 1.5-2.0 meters in populated areas. This was fortunate since a warning could not be sent to the area due to the disrupted communications caused by the earthquake.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1315)\r\n</p><p>Maximum runup height of 10.4 m at the southern part of Dimitrova Bay.

Tonggolobibi is located only 14 kilometers from the epicenter that was a back arc event with deep thrusting. The <b>tsunami destroyed 183 houses</b> and damaged 228 units in the Bangkir-Tolitoli area. It affected about 100 kilometers of the coast but there were no reports of tsunami data being recorded outside of Sulawesi. The land subsided by about one meter. It occurred at high tide. As the wave arrival times were very short, (about five minutes after the earthquake) and several sites reported an initial withdrawal, some of the wave action may have been due to tsunami induced landslides. Breaking waves were also reported at about half of the sites. Three waves were observed. The wave penetrated as much as 200 meters up riverbeds and carried five boats including two 500-ton motorboats 250 meters on shore. Since the tsunami occurred at a high tide of 59 cm, and there was a subsidence of the land of about 70 cm, it was difficult to estimate the wave heights. (reference #1315)\r\n<p>In the Donggala regency, the most heavily damaged area\r\nwas Tongglolbibi village which belongs to the Dempelas\r\nSojol district. The tsunami attacked the village about 5\r\nminutes after the earthquake. The tsunami was reported to\r\n<b>runup 3-5m</b> and extend about 300m inland. A house\r\ndrifted 10m from its original foundation, and two 500-ton\r\nmotor boats drifted 250m ashore. In total, 9 people were\r\nkilled, 163 buildings (mostly wooden houses) were heavily\r\ndamaged, and 102 buildings were slightly damaged. The\r\nsevere effects of the tsunami at Tonggolobibi village were\r\nlikely due to its location on a concave coastline facing\r\ndirectly towards the epicentral area.\r\n</p><p>In the Buol Tolitoli regency, the most affected area was\r\nSoni village which belongs to the Dampal Selatan district.\r\nHowever, damage here is less than that at Tonggolobibi,\r\nand no loss of life occurred. The tsunami was reported to\r\nhave a runup at Soni of 1.5m and extend 200m inland.

Destruction of Minoan towns in North Crete coast (Amnisos, Nirou Khani, Malia, Pseira...) first hypotesised to be the effect of the tsunami by Marinatos [reference #2986]. Devastation from the tsunami occurred along northern Crete, western Cyprus, and the eastern Mediterranean as far as the Syrian coasts. Estimates of height of the tsunami vary from 40 to 90 m. The tsunami may have resulted from the caldera collapse, subsidence, or from an explosion when sea water encountered the hot magma in the collapsing caldera.

Agathias also visited the island in AD 558, on his return from Constantinople, but Guidoboni et al.

The day he reached Luckput there were shocks of an earthquake, which shook down part of the walls of the fort, and some lives were lost. At the same time as the shock the sea rolled up the Koree (the eastern) mouth of the Indus, overflowing the country as far westward as the Goongra river (a distance of twenty English miles), northward as far as a little north of Veyre (forty miles from the mouth of the Koree), and eastward to the Sindree\r\nLake. The guide was detained six days (from June 19th to 25th), during which time sixty-six shocks were counted. He then got across to Kotree, of which only a few small buildings on a bit of rising ground remained. Most of the habitations throughout the district must have been swept away, the best houses in Scinde being built of sun-dried bricks, and whole villages consisting only of huts made of a few crooked poles and reed mats. The guide traveled\r\ntwenty miles through water on a camel, the water up to the beast&#39;s body.

The natives told me that during my absence they had experienced on the coast and the mountains several earthquakes, on which occasions some natives were killed by the falling of cocoanut trees in the villages, which in falling destroyed the huts. The villages on the coast suffered more on account of unusually big waves which followed soon after the earthquake, breaking down the cocoanut trees and sweeping away a few huts nearest to the beach. In revisiting the coast villages, I found many not unimportant changes: stretches of destroyed forest by tidal waves after the earthquake; alteration in the direction of some small streams, the old mouths of which had been closed by bars of sand left behind by waves.

This is a very short time for the tsunami travel time from the tsunami landslides scars proposed by Ratzov et al, 2007, and also for the fault plane for the similar 1942 earthquake, as it is demonstrated in Ioualalen et al, 2011.

According to initial water-level measurements by Stuart Weinstein of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) (via the International Tsunami Bulletin Board), the tsunami was recorded on several tide gauges in southern Mexico and El Salvador. Based on this information, the largest tsunami amplitudes occurred during the first five hours of the observed arrival times at each tide gauge except for the El Salvador location, where the peak occurred 14 hours after first arrival. Videos posted on Youtube indicate that there was minor flooding along the waterfront of the harbor at Puerto Chiapas. In the far field, the maximum tsunami amplitudes from this event were all less than 0.35m, which was the measured amplitude in Owenga, Chatham Islands, in New Zealand (PTWC). (reference #11912)\r\n<p>The associated tsunami waves were recorded first at Huatulco tide gauge station at 5:04 (GMT) 12 min after the earthquake. We covered ground observations along 41 km of the coast of Chiapas, encompassing the sites with the highest projected wave heights based on our preliminary tsunami model (maximum tsunami amplitudes between 94.5 and 93.0W). Runup and inundation distances were measured along eight sites. The tsunami occurred at low tide. The maximum runup was ~3 m at Boca del Cielo, and maximum inundation distance was 190 m in Puerto Arista, corresponding to the coast in front of the epicenter and in the central sector of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Tsunami scour and erosion was evident along the Chiapas coast. Tsunami deposits, mainly sand, reached up to 32 cm thickness thinning landward up to 172 m distance. (reference #11983)</p>",

Additionally assumed an elderly man died, says Greenland Police KNR. (ref #11831)\r\n</p><p>Initially, based on seismic signals, it appeared as if a M&#61;4.1 earthquake caused the slide. However, in the aftermath of the event, scientists have examined the event more carefully, and have now determined that there was no earthquake. Instead, the landslide was so large that it generated significant seismic energy. Two clues that led scientists to see that there had in fact been no earthquake were the duration and characteristic of the seismic signals. Not only did the seismic waves last for approximately five minutes, but they were monochromatic and slowly increased in amplitude (the highest amplitude waves lasted about 30 seconds). Such traits, according to the IRIS blog, authored by John Clinton (ETH Zurich), Tine Larsen, Trine Dahl-Jensen, Peter Voss (GEUS Copenhagen), and Meredith Nettles (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University) are &#34;indicative of complex landslide signals.&#34; (ref #11836)\r\n</p><p>The team, including the acclaimed environmental scientist Hermann Fritz, has estimated that the wave at the coast where the landslide struck reached a marked 90 meters altitude. It is more than twice as high as the Round Tower. On the opposite side of the fjord, the height according to the researchers was 50 meters. (ref #11854)\r\n</p><p>On the evening of 17 June 2017, a landslide-generated tsunami reached the village of Nuugaatsiaq, Greenland. Four persons are presumed dead as a result.</p><p>Based on the 3D OAP terrain model developed from helicopter photos taken 3 weeks after the event, we conclude that the Karrat Fjord landslide was an Btsunamigenic extremely rapid rock avalanche^ with a total mobilized volume of 58 Mm3, approximately 45 Mm3 of which entered the fjord over the span of less than 5 min. The upper extent of the release area was at over 1200- m elevation, and the main body of the rock avalanche source was 800 m across and reached over 300-m thickness in places. (ref #11994)\r\n</p><p>On 17 June 2017, at 21:39 local time, a large landslide (2000 m long and 1100 m wide, Fig. 1a) occurred in Greenland when a landslide mass descended into the sea at Karrat Fjord. Differential digital elevation models (DEMs) estimate a landslide volume of 35-51 million cubic meters. The landslide triggered a tsunami that washed up in a remote region near the village of Nuugaatsiaq, reportedly killing four people, injuring dozens, and washing away eleven homes (Bessette-Kirton et al., 2017). (ref #12130)\r\n</p><p>On June 17 2017, the western coast of Greenland was the site of a tsunami which flooded several villages, killing 4 people and destroying 11 houses in the village of Nuugaatsiaq. This tsunami was triggered by a subaerial landslide which occurred in afjord 32 km ENE of Nuugaatsiaq[...]The 2017 landslide was identified the next day by an aerial survey of the Arktisk Kommando of the Danish Defence, about 32 km ENE of Nuugaatsiaq, upstream Karrat Fjord.

It was the strongest explosion in historical times in Indonesia. It was accompanied by considerable oscillations in sea level. The eruption began on April 1. At 22:00 [local time] at Bajuwangi (Java Island), a cannonade boomed out like peals of distant thunder. It was repeated from time to time, and this continued until 9:00 on the 2nd. On the morning of the 3rd, a light fall of ashes began; on the 5th, explosions began to be heard at 1/4 hour intervals.\r\n</p><p>The eruption reached its peak on the evening of the 10th, when a colossal pillar of smoke rose above the volcano and the entire mountain seemed to eject flame. Soon the volcano and all that occurred there were hidden in a dense cloud of smoke. \r\n</p><p>The sound of a shot was so loud that it was heard for an enormous distance: from Bengkulu and Banka Island in the west to Ternate Island in the east. At Surabaja, the air wave uprooted trees, destroyed the walls of homes, and bowled over people and animals. The tremors were felt more or less strongly at Banjuwangi, Sumenep, Surakarta, Rembang, apparently on the southeast of Kalimantan Island, at Makassar and on Flores Island.\r\n</p><p><b>Scorching hot slag and ashes covered all of Sumbawa Island and a sizeable water area. Buildings collapsed under this load. The previously picturesque island was turned into a desolate desert. Of 12,000 residents, only 26 survived.</b> On neighboring Lombok Island, the depth of the layer of ashes was 0.5 m. A similar layer of ashes was floating at sea west of Sumbawa Island on the 12th. On Java Island, the ashfall was so dense that complete darkness set in. The ashes fell on Java at a distance of 550 km from the volcano; it also fell on Sulawesi Island at Ambon. From this one can conclude that the ash was ejected to a very great height, as otherwise it would have been carried by the trade winds only to the west.\r\n</p><p>On the 10th, with still weather, the sea off the coast of Sumbawa Island suddenly rose to a height of 0.5 to 3.5 m. Large waves burst into the estuaries of the rivers and immediately surged back. Here and there homes and trees were washed away. At Bima, the water submerged the floors of homes by 0.3 m. All the proas and boats were torn from their anchors and tossed onshore. The coast at the Tambora volcano subsided so that water 5-6 m deep appeared in place of the land.\r\n</p><p>Short-period (duration no more than 3 minutes) oscillations in level were noted on Sulawesi and Java Islands. At Sumenep, on the 11th at 19:00 during an ebb tide, a flood tide of water from the bay made the river rise 1-1.5 m; then the level fell for 4 minutes.\r\n</p><p>The explosions of the volcano, which were accompanied by strong tremors, lasted several more days. Eruption finally came to an end only on July 15.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #132:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1815, April 10. Dutch East Indies, Sumbawa, east of Java, Bima.

Many of the fatalities occurred when tsunami capsized boats filled with fleeing residents. Newspaper and other reports suggesting 3,000-5,000 deaths are very unreliable. (reference #9675)\r\n<p>A moderately violent phreatomagmatic explosive eruption of Taal Volcano, in the Philippines, occurred from 28 to 30 September 1965. The main phreatic explosions, which were preceded by ejection of basaltic spatter, opened a new crater 1.5 kilometers long and 0.3 kilometer wide on the southwest side of Volcano Island in Lake Taal. The eruption covered an area of about 60 square kilometers with a blanket of ash more than 25 centimeters thick and killed approximately 190 persons. ..\r\n</p><p>The explosions within the crater area produced shock waves that generated water waves, which probably reached\r\nmaximum height between Volcano Island and the west shore of Lake Taal. These waves capsized some of the boats filled with the fleeing residents of the island and accounted for many of the fatalities. The maximum height of the waves is not known, because evidence of wave height during the early, most violent phase of the eruption is now covered by layers of ash. However, on the west shore of Lake Taal, directly west of the mouth of the explosion crater, there is clear evidence that waves reached 4.7 meters above lake\r\nlevel and swept inshore as much as 80 meters. The debris left by these waves is on top of the air-fall ash, hence the waves must have occurred very late in the eruption. Undoubtedly much larger waves swept that coast earlier. \r\n</p><p>A streamflow gage 1.5 kilometers downstream from the outlet of Lake Taal shows an increase of flow from an average of 20,500 liters per second for several days before the eruption to a maximum of 28,400 liters per second on 28 September, followed by decreases to 23,800 liters per second\r\non 29 September, and 22,800 liters per second on 30 September. Such an increase is probably due to excessive\r\nwave action and to seiches produced by the explosion shock waves, as well as to displacement of water by the ash fall and to the inordinately heavy rain that accompanied the eruption.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #5094)\r\n</p><p>Many of the 190-355 fatalities occurred when tsunami waves capsized boats containing residents fleeing from Taal Island to the western shore of the lake (near Agoncillo).

There was a multiple eruption of the Miyejin submarine volcano (31 deg 56.7 min N., 140 deg 0.5 min E.) 130 km south of Hachijo Island. The augite-hypersthene-dacite composition of the lavas determined the explosive nature of the eruptions.

Some of the eruptions were observed visually from ships and airplanes by Japanese specialists. Thus, during the weak eruption of September 23 at 13h 40m, a water dome, with protuberances 600-800 m high and 2 km in diameter, arose over the volcano. No seaquake was felt , but waves 50 m long and 2 m high spread over the sea surface. During the stronger eruptions weak tsunamis were generated, 52 of which were registered by the tide gauge on Hachijo Island. The strongest of these waves were also registered by tide gauges on Jogashima Island and Cape Omae on the south coast of Japan. The travel time of the waves to Hachijo Island was about 30 minutes, the period 1.5 minutes, the height 10-90 cm. In the nature of dispersion and other parameters, the waves corresponded to theoretical Cauchy-Poisson waves from an initial impulse with a source diameter of 2 &#43; km. Some waves were like pulses. This was apparently due to the interference of waves bending around both sides of Aoga-shima Island, midway between the volcano and Hachijo Island.</p><p>The tsunami of September 26 was recorded in Hilo, in the Hawailan Islands with an amplitude of less than 0.1 m.</p><p>The ship &#34;Kiyo Maru No 5&#34; of the Japanese hydrographic service, which had come out to study the eruption, was lost in the eruption of September 24.</p></blockquote>",

Eastern part of Mediterranean Sea, Hellenic Arc. 21 July 365 before sunrise a strong earthquake [35N 23E, intensity X] and a catastrophic tsunami occurred with source near Crete. The tsunami wave started with a large drop in water level; ships were left high &amp; dry; many sea animals were beached; citizens rushed to the exposed shore to pick up fish with their hands. About 15min later a large wave appeared with a roar, sweeping everything in its path. This turned out to be unexpected for the many thousand people crowding the coast and resulted in their death. Broken ships were found 2km from the coastal line on the southwestern shore of Pelponnesus near Methone. Achaea &amp; other districts (Boeotia, Epirus) in the north of Pelponnesus were damaged. About <strong>5000 people were killed in Greece</strong>.<br />In the northern part of the Adriatic Sea, rivers flowed backwards; the sea retreated from the coastal line. Sailors testified that, as they navigated through the Mediterranean Sea, ships suddenly happened to go aground, but soon the water returned and they continued their voyages. Coast of Sicily was flooded.<br />In Alexandria (probably this was not Alexandria in Egypt, but Alexandria Troas in Asia Minor) the sea retreated to a great distance; big &amp; small ships ran aground.

Major earthquake in the Hellenic Arc, over 900km NW of Lower Egypt, was responsible for a catastrophic sea-wave that played havoc with coastal settlements on the Nile Delta. Contemporary historians say that in Alexandria...sea passed beyond its boundaries and flooded a great deal of land, so that on the retreat of the waters the sea-skiffs were found lodged on the roofs of houses. In the region of the lagoon of al-Manzala, east of the Delta between Damietta and Port Said, the land previously rich became a desert:...the sea rose suddenly due to the earthquake, rushing over its limits, ruining all villages, covering with salt the land which before was fertile...only villages on high ground survived. Later writers add that in Alexandria alone <strong>50000 houses were flooded and 5000 people were drowned</strong>; ships were carried by the waves over the city walls and boats in the Nile were deposited on dry land about 3.5km from river. The region of Tinnis and the town itself were totally destroyed. The sea-wave had equally destructive effects in other parts of the eastern Mediterranean region...more likely that the damaging effects of the earthquake were confined between Messenia and Laconia in the Peloponnese, the west part of Crete and Cyrenaiea, but not further west.(ref #3845)</p><p>365 July 21. 35N 23E, magnitude 8, intensity X, tsunami intensity VI.

On 18 September 1601, central Switzerland was hit by one of the largest known earthquakes in central Europe (I &#61; VII-VIII, Mw - 6.2; Swiss Seismological Service, 2002). Several towers in Lucerne were destroyed, and Renward Cysat, the registrar of Lucerne at that time, reported in his chronicle, &#34;What scared people most was that the out flowing river Reuss flowed back into Lake Lucerne so that the riverbed between the two parts of the city almost became dry and several people\r\ncould cross it by foot, before the water again vehemently advanced towards the city&#34; (Cysat, 1601, p. 884). As Cysat traveled along the lake&#39;s shore, he recorded observations such as: &#34;Ships had been thrown onshore ... up to two halberds [~4 m] aboye the lake level. ... Small islands and shoals had disappeared,&#34; (p. 883) as did &#34;entire houses with sleeping people&#34; (Cysat, 1601, p. 887). In Lucerne, the cyclic oscillation of lake level (seiche) had a period of 10 min and an estimated amplitude of 1-2 m (Cysat, 1601; Siegenthaler et al., 1987). An earthquake of this magnitude could not have directly caused such massive water movements that lasted several hours. In fact, Siegenthaler et al. (1987) linked these large-scale water movements of A.D. 1601 to two large slump deposits in the subsurface of Lake Lucerne.",

There was an earthquake (17 S 72 W, mag 8.5) and tsunami in Peru and in the northern part of Chile. The tsunami flooded the coastline for a distance of 1200 km. Arica suffered most of all. According to a report of the governor of Arica, the ocean receded a distance of two musket shots further than its normal low water point, and then, while the tremors were still occurring, raged with such force that it covered the islet of Alacran, situated opposite the high part of the city. A barrack-type building (wooden or adobe) was carried away with this first wave. The second shock, which occurred 15 minutes after the first ebb, caused the water to recede again, only to reappear in rising form, sweeping the town and carrying away warehouses, stores, and a large church, and advancing another 100 m inland and destroying all houses. Subsequently, the water receded to the point where the anchors of all ships were exposed... Three persons drowned in Arica itself, and more than twenty along the coast... In Ilo, the water rose to a point where it advanced almost 2 km inland along a valley uprooting 100-year old fig trees. Eleven indians were drowned... Three high tides and ebbs were reported to have occurred in Camana. The water advanced along a valley for more than 2 km destroying everything in its path. Forty persons were washed away and drowned. \r\n<p>1705, November 26 (or 16). An earthquake occurred in Arequipa and Arica, and the wave generated during that quake flooded and destroyed a large part of Arica.

First Arica Earthquake. (Arica was probably affected by earlier earthquakes, such as the great Arequipa, Peru, earthquake of January 22, 1582; but no documents exist.) The exact date is given in an inventory of military supplies salvaged\r\nfrom the tsunami, dated December 5, 1604 and signed by the\r\nCorregidor of Arica. The port of Arica, formerly located near the center of the bay, was completely destroyed by the tsunami and the town was rebuilt at its present location, close to the famous Rock or &#34;Morro&#34; of Arica. Arequipa, in the Peruvian interior at a distance of about 260 km, was almost completely destroyed; only the convent of San Francisco remained standing. People were thrown to the ground by the earthquake; the losses were estimated at more than a million gold pesos. The tsunami is not accurately described, but it is known that at least three successive waves flooded the coast line along an extension of 300 &#34;leguas&#34;, or 1200 km. The Peruvian port of Pisco more than 800 km northwest of Arica, was damaged by the tsunami according to one report. Damage from the tsunami extended across the Pacific Ocean. The effects of this great earthquake, as far as they are known, were similar to those of the great Arica earthquake of August 13, 1868. The\r\nmagnitude is estimated at 8 1/4-8 1/2.

A destructive tsunami, which enveloped the coast for a distance of over 1000 km, occurred almost simultaneously. For the first time in its history, the port of Valparaiso was flooded and considerably damaged. In the lower area of Almendral, all houses, fortifications and warehouses were destroyed by the flood. In Concepcion, the sea receded a great distance, only to &#34;swell&#34; and advance so quickly that it swept everything in its path, inundating the fields and town. Only two or three persons perished, since the inhabitants, on first noting the receding sea, ran for the hills from where they watched the destruction of their houses and their property. In Valdivia, the river was backed up by the ocean flow. In Coquimbo, the tsunami destroyed several ranches on the shore. In Callao and environs on the 8th of July, it was noted that the sea level slowly rose. <p>The waves reached the northeastern coast of the island of Honshu. In the prefecture of Miyagi on the Djika Peninula, on July 9, houses and rice fields were flooded.\r\n(reference #415)\r\n</p><p>The tsunami was reported on the South American coast between Callao and Valdivia, inundating cities of Valparaiso and Concepcion.

Five very strong earthquakes occurred in a short interval of time (February-March), causing destructions and a lot of victims in a vast region embracing the whole southern Calabria and the Messina area, Sicily.  The 5 February [12hr] earthquake abruptly opened the seismic period. More than 380 villages damaged, 180 almost totally ruined. More than 25,000 victims, mostly because of the violent fire following the shock. \r\n<p>Coast from Messina to Torre del Faro (about 11 miles) and from Cenidio to Scilla (about 7 miles) heavily affected by the tsunami. Sea generally reported to recede and then to inundate the shore. Withdrawals and inundations repeated at least three times at intervals of about 10-15 min. At Joppolo a cosiderable sea withdrawal was observed leaving sea bottom dried. In the sea between Nicotera and Gioa Tauro, two waves seen to form by two fishermen: one travelled toward Capo Vaticano and the other toward Gioia del Tirreno. This was as high as a big vessel, but caused no damage. Probably the same fact reported occurring about 8 minutes after the shock. At Nicotera where two big waves were observed to form offshore: one heading toward the coast, the other travelling seaward. At Nicotera the sea withdrew boiling and then turned the fishing-boats upside-down. At Gioa del Tirreno the sea inundated the shore without any damage. At Scilla the sea withdrew for more than 10 meters leaving the sea bottom dry and a lot of fish on the beach; then suddenly the water came back surpassing its usual limit of about 1,5 meters and flooding the coast. Oscillation repeated with period of 15 minutes. \r\nAt Messina the sea overpassed the quays, destroying them, and violently inundated the theathre Marittimo. Sea agitated for three days after the main shock. At Torre del Faro, sea retreat followed by inundation observed. The water of the two marshes, Pantano Piccolo and Pantano Grande, receded). The sea coming back, partly destroyed the lighthouse and penetreted as far as the two marshes, inundating wineyards, then withdrew dragging many boats livestock and leaving fish on shore. The sea receding dragged some fishermen. At Catona the sea flooded the coast for a short stretch. At Reggio Calabria the sea surpassed the beach arriving at the coastal road inundating some twon district. At San Gregorio a rockfall fell into the sea generating sea waves. In the stretch of coast from Bianco to Roccella Ionica (about 35 km long) the beach was flooded by about one mile. At Roccella the wave was observed about 7 minutes after the shock. The sea reached the monastery of the Minims Paolotti carrying many boats onland.\r\n</p><p>Simulated numerically by Tinti (ref #1407).\r\n<br />Revisions: Graziani (ref #3954), Tinti (ref #2761).</p>",

The inhabitants, panic-stricken, abandoned their homes and families and are still living in the open air, fearing a repetition of the shocks. In the neighborhood of Port Limon four small islands disappeared. These islands were inhabited by fishermen, who escaped in small boats, which they were at sea for three days, until the water became sufficiently calm to enable them to reach the mainland. The city of Esmeraldas was nearly inundated by a tidal wave which entered the port, flooding the principal streets. All the inhabitants ran for the mountains in the neighborhood. All the towns in the provinces of Esmeraldas and Manabi were greatly damaged. Most of the inhabitants are homeless. At the Colombian towns of Mosquera, San Juan and Domingoritz more than 300 persons perished. (reference #8876)\r\n</p><p>1906. High waves invaded Los Negritos Beach.

A catastrophic earthquake (intensity&#61;XI), preceded by a strong shock of an hour earlier, took place on the Isthmus of Corinth. The sea level rose suddenly in the port of Karistos in the south of the island of Euboea: the rise of the sea level reached 30 cm for 10 min. Then the water rolled away from the coast at a velocity of 3-4 knots and became 10 cm lower. This phenomenon was repeated several times over 22 hours, reaching its greatest intensity at 11h, when one boat could not leave the port in spite of all the efforts of the oarsmen in it, and a sailing vessel could not come into the port, slued round and dropped anchor on the roadstead. Strange drops in the sea level were observed on the same day on the Island of Skyros to the east of the Island of Euboea. The movements of the sea should apparently have been related precisely to the strong earthquake that occurred on April 22, although the time of the earthquake and the reported time of the noticed oscillations of the sea level did not coincide.

This is considered as the strongest shallow earthquake occurred in Greece in this century.  53 people were killed, 100 injured. The main shock was followed 13 later by an aftershock of Ms&#61;7.2 located about 5 km ENE of Santorini (Perissoratis, r468).\r\nThis earthquake activity was associated with a very large tsunami 25 m heigh, observed in the southern coasts of Amorgos, and which affected all other central and southern Aegean islands and the northern coasts of Crete, where its heigh was 1-2 m (Perissoratis, r468). The tsunami source was located in the deepest patt of the Strait of Amorgos (Soloviev, r643).\r\nThe severity of the waves of July 9, 1956, was not uniform. It varied greatly from place to place and over rather short distances. Waves up to 15 m in height were observed and many casualties were reported. The area affected by the waves exceeded 40,000 square miles and the distrubance of the sea lasted over 24 hours (Ambraseys, r457). (reference #4139)\r\n<p>The tsunami caused the greatest damage on the Island of Kalymnos because the main settlements of the island were grouped on the shore facing the wave source. The sea in the town of Pothea at first receded, and then rushed onto the coast in the form of a large crest and flooded the town completely. The rise of water was 2.5m, but the pressure of the water current was very strong. The port constructions and houses within the 90 m wide coastal strip suffered\r\nsignificantly. Over 30 fishing boats and one large sailing boat were thrown out onto the dry land and smashed. The sea receded and rose three times during the first hour. Various fragments and objects were carried 1.5 km deep onto the\r\nisland; one person was lifted up by the wave and carried 1 km onto the dry land, <b>three people were drowned</b>; a large area of topsoil was washed away.

(Reference #1053)\r\n<p>As a result of the earthquake and tsunami over <b>8,000 persons were killed or missing. 10,000 were injured</b>, and 90,000 were left homeless. Based on the investigation of the affected regions it was concluded that the maximum waves in Moro Gulf reached a height of 4-4.8 m which was much lower than what was reported by the press. Large waves were also observed at heights of 4.3 m in Alicia, Pagadian, and on Bongo Island; 3.4 m on Lebak, and at 3 m on Resa Bay, the eastern coast of Basilan and the Jolo Islands, and on Sacol Island. In Lake Cebu, seiches (standing waves) appeared. A tsunami with a maximum amplitude of 35 cm was recorded by tide gauges in Davao.

A total of 1,440 peopled died in Zamboanga del Sur, 7,701 people were injured and 909 were reported missing and believed to have drowned at sea. Most of the fatalities were residents of the coastal villages of Pagadian. A total of 49,848 people lost their homes. Of the 11 coastal villages in Pagadian, Santa Lucia was the hardest hit because it was more populated and several communities are situated in the mangrove areas. Mondarte [Santa Lucia barangay chair was then an engineering graduate] remembered that when the waves subsided, hundreds of bodies littered the village.

        "comments": "1977, August 19. A catastrophic earthquake shook Sumbawa Island. It covered an extensive area from the southern coast of Indonesia to the northwestern coast of Australia. A large tsunami was produced. The first press reports announced waves 30 m high in Indonesia and 8 m high in Australia Apparently, these figures were exaggerated. A group from the International Tsunami Information Center\r\nvisited the coastal regions of Sumba, Sumbawa, Lombok and Bali Islands to assess the destruction and wave run-ups, and to obtain other detailed information from local people. Inaccessible areas on the southern coast of Sumba and\r\nSumbawa islands were photographed from the air. Information was processed that had been gathered by the Indonesian military, search and rescue parties, provincial administration, and by medical teams visiting accessible areas in the coastal villages to offer help and assess the extent of loss of property and life. These records were supplemented by radio broadcast accounts from individual\r\nsettlements. <p>The southern coasts of the islands, with the exception of Bali, is sparsely populated. Villages are generally small and scattered. Hence the loss of human life was not high. According to incomplete data, over 180 people were killed and 3,900 were left homeless. Fishing boats and equipment were lost. For a large part of the Indonesian territory, which had sustained heavy damage from the tsunami, no information is available on the height of the rise in the water level. However, in the accessible region of Sumbawa Island, preliminary information reported that the tsunami reached a height of at least 15 m above the\r\nhigh-tide mark and inundated the island up to 500 m inland.\r\n</p><p>According to eyewitness accounts, the tsunamis appeared on the Indonesian coast about an hour or two after high tide, beginning with an ebb, which soon left a 100-200 m wide drained belt. This was followed by three large waves with a period of about 5 min or less. The first wave was the\r\nhighest and most ferocious. Several witnesses noted the duration of agitation of the sea although most made no mention of it. An unusual phenomenon occurred during the time interval between the earthquake and the arrival of the tsunami. Residents of villages in the Sumbawa and Lombok Islands thrice heard a sound at intervals estimated from a few seconds to 1 min and more. It was diversely described as sounding like a bomb explosion or a sonic boom. The sound\r\nreportedly emanated from the epicentral area. Nearly every village reported that the water became black and some reported a rise in temperature and an unpleasant smell. The tsunami reached a height of more than 10 m along the coast of Sumbawa. The main destruction was observed on the Sumbawa and Lombok islands.</p><p>The tsunami was also observed on the northern and western coasts of Australia. It was reported that on-the Australian coast, as on the Indonesian coast, three waves appeared, the first being the largest. Agitation of the sea continued for several hours. In Dampier the wave reached a height of 2 m; in Port Sampson it varied from 2 to 4 m; in Cape Leveque it reached 6 m. The arrival of the tsunami coincided with an observable ebb and a low tide in many places. These factors weakened the overall effect of the tsunami. Evidently, no lives were lost in Australia although there was one report of a person drawn into the sea by waves.</p><p>(above from reference #417)\r\n</p><p>A magnitude 8.0 Ms earthquake south of Sumbawa Is generated a tsunami that completely destroyed several villages. At least 100 people were killed, 89 reported missing and 75 injured. Most of the casualties and damage were caused by the tsunami. (reference #1053).\r\n</p><p>$1.2 million damage, 185 killed, 3900 homeless. (reference #1250)\r\n</p><p>On an inaccessible section of Sumbawa Is, a preliminary study indicates that the waves reached at least 15 meters above high tide, and penetrated about 500 meter inland in some valleys.

The maximum runup/wave height was reported to be 2 to 3 m, and inundation and coastal flooding extended up to 100 m inland in some locations. Both coseismic coastal uplift and the presence of fringing offshore reefs appear to have provided protection against major runup effects in some coastal areas. Elsewhere, runup effects were amplified at river mouths due to differential compaction of unconsolidated sediments.

Credible re-ports from residents in coastal towns and villages observed the sea receding 50-150 meters from the shore almost immediately after the earthquake. A 150-m recession and estimated 3-m high wave, was reported by General Magsino, a participant in the US-RP &#34;Balikatan&#34; Exercise, who ordered everyone to immediately evacuate to high ground. Two boats were damaged when the waves returned after a few minutes. In Maitum, the sea receded 300 m from the shore and the onrushing waves destroyed a pump boat; dead fish were observed soon after. In Kiamba, the sea receded 5-8 m and then rose back again, and people fled to the mountain. Subsequent tsunami modelling in collaboration with JICA expert Dr. Yuchiro Tanioka predicted 3-m high tsunami in Palimbang followed by a recession a minute after the earthquake, which were consistent with eyewitness accounts and damage reports.

The tsunami was also recorded in Lazaro Cardenas-Michoacan, 200 km SE from the epicenter, and in Zihautanejo-Guerrero, 278 SE from the epicenter. Eyewitnesses interviewed by telephone the day after the earthquake reported NO tsunami in Manzanillo (report from Oceanographic Institute of the Navy), NO tsunami along the coast of Jalisco (reports from Barra de Navidad and Melaque) and NO tsunami at the Port of Lazaro Cardenas, Michoacan (report from the Captain of t he Port). Note that it was night at the time of the earthquake, which made it difficult for eyewitnesses to observe sea level fluctuations that did not overpass the higher part of the beach (the winter berm) which is on the average 1-2 meters above the high tide level along the coasts of Jalisco, Colima, and Michoacan. A field survey was conducted on January 26-28 along the coast, from La Manzanilla-Jalisco to San Juan-Michoacan, to seek tsunami traces and to determine how the people living near the coast responded to the possible tsunami. Results of the survey confirmed that no tsunami flooding occurred along the entire surveyed coast. It was also confirmed that the height of the tsunami along the coast was approximately the height of the high tide, as recorded in Manzanillo, and that it was difficult for the untrained eye to observe sea level fluctuations within the tidal range.</p>",

The shock was so violent that many fortresses were thrown to the ground and the long walls at Kherronisos collapsed. In many places chasms opened into the ground and many towns perished in them. Many other misfortunes occurred, both on land as well as at sea. Springs ceased to flow and new ones burst forth. Trees were flung up roots and all and landslides changed the shape of mountains. From the sea dead fish was hurled violently on shore and many islands were inundated; and when the sea retired sailing ships were left standing on shore. The two Phrygias Bythinia and the Hellespontos suffered. This calamity persisted for a long time, though not with the same violence as it began; with time the shaking faded out until it stopped ...&gt;&gt;</p><p>This earthquake seems to have centered on the northern part of the Marmara area, and although Evagrios does not name the islands which were flooded by the sea-wave, it seems probable that they were the islets in the Sea of Marmara.</p><p>All historians concerned agree in the date of this event which can be placed in the first week of Nov 447 AD.</p><p>(above from ref #23)</p>",

There was a large earthquake with source near San Marcos, affecting the coast of the states of Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoacan and causing much destruction. The earthquake generated a tsunami that was observed in Acapulco and <strong>tore 11 men to pieces</strong> and left them to hang between the beams of a rather high bridge 6 km from the sea. The few who were saved were <strong>injured</strong> and very frightened. A galleon from the Philippine islands was riding in the harbor of Acapulco at a depth of 18 m. During the ebb tide, the water shallowed to 8.5 m. The city was destroyed. The wave was also observed in the region of Pochutla, Tehuantepec and other settlements in the state of Oaxaca. (reference #415)</p><p>1787, Mar. 14 (also Mar. 18, Mar. 28). Sea withdrew exposing rocks. Galleon reported 11 m lowering. Other places mentioned by Milne and by Heck are places where the earthquake was felt. Mar. 14 is date given by Belcher. Mallet gives both Mar. 14 and Mar. 18 but points out events on the two dates were probably the same. Mar. 28 is given by Sieberg and by Japan Meteorological Agency (Anon, 1964) and by Milne who also gives Apr. 3 [as end of quake series?]. (reference #79)</p><p>1787, Mar. 14 or 18. Mexico, near San Marcos. Felt along coast of Oaxaca, Michoacan, and south of Tehuantepec. Sea retired, leaving rocks of Punta Manzanilla dry, and returned very high, estimated at 36 feet by vessel at anchor.&#34; References Mallet (reference #497) and Becher (reference #1913). (reference #132)</p><p>1787 March 14. A violent earthquake in Acapulco. The sea retired as far as some rocks lying in the middle of the bay. The galleon of the Philippine Isles, which was mooored in 10 fathom water, found but 4 fathoms when the sea had retreated. The city was ruined. (reference #497)</p><p>1787, March 18, in the morning. Earthquake in Mexico extending from San Luigi de Potosi to Oaxaca, and from Vera-Cruz to Acapulco and Valladolid. Earthquake shocks from the S.E. At the city of Mexico the earth was in almost continual agitation for 24 hours. At Acapulco the sea retreated far from the shore, and returned high above its former level. From this circumstance it seems probable that the event of the 14th March has either been confounded with, or was the same at this. The city of Oaxaca was most injured. (reference #497)</p>",

        "comments": "1939, December 26. An earthquake on December 26, 1939 in Turkey between Erzincan and Erzurum caused a small tsunami in the Black Sea. In Fatsa, a harbor on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, the sea receded 50 m from the shore. Then the sea dashed up the shore as far as 20 m above the normal water level [inundation]. The wave action slowly diminished until the sea returned to its normal state. A small tsunami reached the Black Sea coast of the [former] USSR and was recorded by tide gauges. These waves were recorded by almost all of the tide gauge stations on the Black Sea coast of the Crimea and the Caucasus.  The tsunami began with the rise of the sea level in all places except Batumi. Batumi was the nearest [former] USSR tide gauge to the epicenter of the earthquake. The comparison of the calculated wave travel-time data with the observed\r\ndata suggests that the source of the tsunami should have been either on the shore of the Black Sea near the coast of Turkey, between Batumi and Sinop, or inland. It is difficult to say anything definite about the mechanism of generation of this tsunami. It is not known whether it was\r\ngenerated by tectonic movement, or as that of a secondary phenomena, such as the landslide pointed out by B. Gutenberg Gutenberg, 1939] in 1939 in connection with the Atacama earthquake on November 11, 1922. (reference #2778)",

Wave traces could be seen on buildings up to 40 cm from the ground in a village less than 1 meter above sea level. Some liquefaction was 1 m in diameter and 40 cm deep. Concurrently, Indonesian agencies with tide data found that none of three stations in the area recorded signs of a tsunami, but that a GLOSS station in Ambon showed a small disturbance that was difficult to identify as a tsunami wave.

The earthquake generated tsunami waves. They were 2-3 m high in Jijel and flooded the shore several times. Lops in the sea were conserved for three days and nights. The sea near Philippeville suddenly receded and gradually returned flooding the shore up to a height of 60 cm. It receded after the earthquake in Bougie by approximately 35 m and then rose 5 m and flooded the shore 5-6 times. The sea near Bougie rose along the shore by approximately 1 m and flooded the coastal strip several times; it lasted 12 h. According to Ambraseys, the formation of this and of the previous tsunami was not related to seismo-tectonic movements of the sea bottom, but to turbulent flows, as during the September 9, 1954 events.

The edifice of Yate volcano, a dissected stratocone in the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone, has experienced multiple summit collapses throughout postglacial time restricted to sectors NE and SW of the summit. The largest such historic event occurred on 19th February 1965 when ~6.1x10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> of rock and ice detached from 2,000-m elevation to the SW of the summit and transformed into a debris flow. In the upper part of the flow path, velocities are estimated to have reached 40 m s.1. After travelling 7,500 m and descending 1,490 m, the flow entered an intermontane lake, Lago Cabrera. A wavemaker\r\nof estimated volume 9<u>&#43;</u>3x10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> generated a tsunami with an estimated amplitude of 25 m and a run-up of ~60 m at the west end of the lake where a settlement disappeared with the loss of 27 lives.

        "comments": "October 16, 1979, 14h00m (local time). Ligurian Sea, France. Waves of the tsunami type suddenly beat down on\r\nFrench Riviera. The sea receded 300 m on the shore between the beach of La Salis to the south of Antibes and the vicinity of Nice, i.e. over a distance of 60 km, and then it returned with two crests 10 m high. Six people were killed and three were lost. Numerous coastal buildings were damaged, many cars were smashed, boats that had been moored were torn away and carried off to sea. Repeated oscillations of the sea level continued for over 4 hours along a 100 km stretch of coast. The waves were not preceded by an earthquake, but an embankment 300 m long, which had been erected in the delta of the River Var\r\non an underwater platform, disappeared into the sea in a matter of minutes practically at the same time as the waves. It was therefore assumed that the oscillations of the sea level were caused by a powerfid underwater landslide. The collapse of the embankment alone seemed to be insufficient to generate the splash of the water observed. The bathymetric survey conducted by the\r\nhydrographic service and by other organisations of France revealed considerable depressions in the river bottom on the eastern edge of the underwater canyon of the River Le Paillon and on the western edge of the canyon of the River Var. A landslide of the vanished material of 400 million m<sup>3</sup> in volume could easily have caused the waves observed. The underwater telephone cables, belonging to Italy, from Genoa to the Balearic Islands and from Genoa to Sassari on the Island of Sardinia were torn at 17h45m and 22h, respectively, on October 16; the sites of gaps were located 80 km and 110 km to the south of Nice, respectively. The first cable was damaged along a distance of 80 km, the second along a distance of 30 km. The\r\ncables from Cannes to L&#39;le Rousse (the Island of Corsica) and from Barcelona to Pisa did not suffer. (reference #2130)\r\n<p>A submarine slope failure occurred during the construction of the Nice new harbour. No seismic event recorded. Except one person in Antibes, the victims were working men on the building site. This gravitational submarine sliding generated a tsunami observed by several witnesses in the Baie des Anges. The maximum effects were observed 10 km from the building site near Antibes, that was inundated (one person killed). Wave heights of about 1 m observed. At La Salis (close to Antibes), witnesses reported a first wave of about 50 cm, 5 minutes after the landslide. This wave was followed by three 3 m high waves with a period of about 8 minutes. At the harbour of Saint Laurent du Var water went down (about 2 m) 1 minute after the landslide and then went up with an amplitude of 1 m.\r\nThe tide-gauge records of Nice and of Villefranche show that the first wave is a trough of about 10 cm. The maximum recorded wave amplitudes do not exceed 10 cm in both harbours, whereas witnesses reported wave amplitudes of about 1 m. Tsunami intensity 3. (reference #4139)</p>",

During this time the intensity and aspect of the eruption were continually changing. It was two hundred days of devastation and ruin for the inhabitants, to whom the time must have appeared an eternity.

On the evening of the feast of All Saints the volcano again began to vomit forth fire, stones, sand, mud, and ashes in a greater quantity than ever. This went on till November 15, on which date, after vespers, there commenced a succession of rumblings, so loud as to deafen one, and the volcano began to vomit forth smoke so dense and black as to darken the atmosphere, and at the same time such a great quantity of large stones fell into the lake as to cause big waves. The earth trembled, the houses shook, and yet this was but the preparation for a fresh rain of scoriae and ashes, which lasted the whole of the afternoon and part of the night.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2070)\r\n</p><p>Twelve persons are known to have perished - some carried away by the waves of the lake, others crushed beneath their collapsing homes.

A great number of detonations were heard in the air, and shortly after it became plain that the volcano in Lake Bombon had burst on its southeastern side, which faces Lipa, so that the whole point called Calauit appeared to be on fire. Later on the eruption seemed to spread into the lake, in the direction of Mount Macolod, which rises opposite the volcano on the southeastern shore of the lake. Great masses of smoke, water, and ashes rushed out of the lake, high up into the air, looking like towers.  Simultaneously there was a great commotion in the earth which stirred up the water in the lake, forming immense waves which lashed the shores as though a violent typhoon were raging. Their fury was such that in front of the Convento of Taal, and in other places of the beach, a strip of more than 10 brazas [16.7 meters] in width was engulfed by the water, and the church was endangered. On the following days, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, things continued in the same way, but by Sunday all the combustible material appears to have been consumed. This eruption killed all the fishes, large and small, the waves casting them ashore in a state as if they had been cooked, since the water had been heated to a degree that it appeared to have been taken from a boiling caldron. There was an all-pervading, pestilential stench of sulphur which greatly molested the inhabitants of the towns surrounding the lake. Sunday morning the sun broke through, but later torrential rains fell with thunder and lightning, some of the latter striking and the whole causing the greatest terror. Finally, however, the weather cleared, and of the whole tragedy there remained no other signs than the stench of sulphur and of the great quantity of dead fish cast upon the beach by the waves.

The shock almost totally ruined the greater part of Vostiza (Egio). Many houses, churches and towers collapsed with <b>little or no loss of life</b>, due to the fact that the people, warned by the foreshock, had taken refuge in the open. The shock caused serious damage to settlements on either side of the Gulf of Corinth, destroying a number of small villages on the northern coast of the Gulf opposite Vostiza and to the east as far as near Corinth. At Corinth some parts of the mosque of Sultan Mehmet II were damaged. To the west of Vostiza, in Patra, the earthquake caused great panic and some minor damage. The shock was strongly felt in Zante and throughout the Peloponnese.\r\n</p><p>Following the earthquake the sea in the Gulf of Corinth near Vostiza receded a great distance from the shore and, on returning with great violence, flooded the town three times. The third wave was so large that it reached the upper part of the town, beyond the Platanos, flooding the hill slopes to the south that overlook the town, washing away houses, stores and the customs house, and stripping trees of their leaves. Destruction was instantaneous and all sailing ships, boats and two large coasting vessels in the port at the time of the earthquake were totally destroyed. A seaman was carried by the waves 500 m inland and deposited unharmed on the hillside above the town. The sea wave added to the earthquake damage all along the central part of the Gulf of Corinth, where <b>many people and domestic animals were swept away and drowned</b>, the wave leaving behind it a great quantity of shells and dead fish, which littered the streets of Vostiza and of other villages along the coast.\r\n</p><p>Aftershocks continued for many weeks, causing the survivors to flee their villages, some of them moving permanently to Patras and Zante.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #9116)\r\n</p><p>1748, May 25. 38.3 N, 22.1 E, magnitude 6.8.

There was a destructive earthquake (37N 73W, mag 8.25) and tsunami in the center part of Chile with its source near Concepcion. </p><p>When the earthquake began, the whole surface of water in Concepcion (Talcahuano) Bay churned. The water darkened and gave off the very unpleasant odor of hydrogen sulphide. At approximately one half hour after the earthquake, the water in the bay receded to the point where all rocks and reefs were laid bare. Then it flooded once more and again receded so that vessels anchored in the bay appeared to be on dry land. Then a huge wave, from the island of Quiriquina, passed along the west shore of the bay, shearing off houses, uprooting trees, sweeping and carrying away everything that was movable... After several minutes a second huge wave appeared, approaching with an even more terrifying noise and violence than the first. Despite the enormity of the wave, its passage was less destructive since there was little left to destroy... After several minutes of tense expectancy, the inhabitants, who had taken refuge on higher ground, saw a third wave rolling between the island of Quiriquina and the mainland.. This wave appeared even larger than the two previous ones (by other accounts, it was somewhat smaller); it roared, dashing against obstacles and carrying along everything in its path. Then suddenly, as if repulsed by the foothills, the water receded, carrying away such a huge quantity of articles snatched from houses (partitions, furniture, etc.), that after the ebb, the whole ocean appeared to be covered with this wreckage. This disaster prompted the inhabitants to begin noticing approaching waves when they were still 5-7 km away from shore. </p><p>\r\nWaves were reported along the coast from Valparaiso to the island of Chiloe, a distance of more than 1000 km.\r\n</p><p>In Talcahuano Bay, one woman took to a boat with her son, but...the boat split and the <b>woman drowned</b>.  Near Niebla Port, Valdivia, a <b>man and a woman drowned</b>, apparently while collecting shellfish. </p><p>A segment of the Chilean coast in the earthquake focal zone was elevated. The bay at Talcahuano became shallower while the shore of the bay was lifted approximately 1 m. The coast at San Vicente rose 0.5 m. Santa Maria Island rose 2.5-3 m in the middle, 3 m in the north, 2.5 m in the south. Mocha Island rose 0.5 m. Then the elevated block slowly subsided and after 2 months the rise of the shores at Talchuano was reduced to 0.5 m. This subsidence apparently came to a stop simultaneously with the cessation of the aftershocks.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #3903:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>&#34;[Charles] Darwin described the tidal wave at Valdivia in 1835, again following a severe earthquake, as producing a quiet rapid rise and rapid fall...[At Concepcion] Thirty minutes after the earthquake the sea retired so far as to strand ships in 7 fathoms of water. All the reefs came into view. Then the return wave poured in thirty feet above high tide. Two others followed, some minutes apart, and progressively bigger.

A strong earthquake in Sanriku, Honshu Island, was felt over an enormous area and generated a catastrophic tsunami. According to official accounts, 10,617 buildings were washed away, 27,122 people died, and 9,247 people were injured... The tsunami was observed at least from the south of Hokkaido Island to the Bonin Islands, and also on the Hawaiian Islands and in North America. The Sanriku coast on a stretch of more than 400 km from Kinkazan Island in the south to Cape Shiriya in the north, suffered most of all.\r\n</p><p>At most places on the Sanriku coast, the tsunami began with a noticeable ebb tide. The exact time of the beginning of the ebb tide in the pleistoseismic area is unknown. According to the data of the hydrometeorological station at Miyako and the accounts of some eyewitnesses, the ebb tide began at nightfall, 15-30 minutes after the earthquake. The first tidal wave arrived immediately after 20:00. Consequently, the time difference between the beginning of the ebb tide and the arrival of the tidal wave was 30 minutes. The magnitude of the ebb tide naturally depended on the depth of the sea: in shallows, the water retreated a great distance, while at deep places, it retreated a small distance. Thus the water retreated 350 m at Horiuchi, 350-550 m at Ryoisi and Ooya, 500 m at Minatohama and 35 m at Tadaide.</p><p>Before the flood tide, a loud rumble like thunder or the noise of a squall could be heard from far at sea. The wave appeared simultaneously with the rumble on the coast of Kesen district, Iwate Prefecture, while it appeared soon after the rumble at other places. It is said that it was even heard in the prefectures of Akita and Yamagata.</p><p>It is also very difficult to establish the time of arrival of the tidal wave. The time, estimated by the hydrometeorological station at Miyako, 20:07 can be considered the most precise. According to the report of this station, the tsunami began 18 minutes after the first underground shock. A flood tide began at about 20:00, and a wave of great height, accompanied by a loud rumble, arrived at 20:07. Then the flood tides recurred six times: at 20:15, 20:32, 20:48, 20:59, 21:16 and 21:50. The second, the largest wave, washed away many people and carried\r\nhomes out to sea.</p><p>The average period of oscillations on the Sanriku coast after the arrival of the tsunami was about 15 minutes. The intensity of the waves began to gradually abate after 22:00, but small oscillations in sea level were still being observed at noon of the following day. The greatest height of rise of water was registered at Yoshihama and Ryori. The second, greatest wave was 24 m high at Yoshihama and the water rose 30 m at Ryori.</p><p>On June 15, the residents of the prefectures on the Sanriku coast were celebrating a national holiday in the streets; there was no work that day. After the ebb tide, with which the tsunami began, some hurried away from the water, but the majority continued the festivities. Practically the entire population of the flooded zone, except for a few individuals miraculously spared, perished in the roller which fell on the Sanriku coast. In addition, the fishermen who had gone out to sea were saved; returning home in the morning, knowing nothing about the events, they saw a horrible picture: the sea was strewn with debris of homes and corpses for several km from shore and heaps of ruins or bare expanses remained in place of the previous coastal villages and cities.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #150:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1896, June 15, (19:33 local time). 39.5 N, 144 E, magnitude 7.6, Sanriku. 26,360 deaths (22,000 deaths by Yamashita), more than 11,000 homes wrecked and washed away.

In Messina all buildings ruined and after the shock a violent fire broke out. In Reggio Calabria all buildings ruined. The area of destruction was about 6,000 square km wide. More than 60,000 people died. Some strong foreshocks occurred on December 5, 6, 23, 25 and many aftershocks occurred till February 1909.</p><p>Violent tsunami in the Messina Straits that caused severe damage and hundreds of victims. In most places the first movement was a sea withdrawal (in some places about 200 m) for a few minutes. Then the sea flooded the coast with at least three big waves. The sea level oscillations lasted many hours, gradually diminishing. The tsunami reached its maximum intensity in the Calabrian coast near Pellaro, Lazzaro and Gallico and, in the Sicily coast, in Giardini and S.Alessio. It was very strong in the eastern Sicily coast and it was observed in the Tyrrhenian Calabria as far as Porto S.Venere and in Sicily as far as Trabia and Termini Imerese. In some localities the biggest wave was the first, while in others it was the second. The observed maximum wave height generally was an inverse function of the distance from the epicenter, but in the Strait this was masked by local amplification effects. A post-event survey allowed for damage estimates, flooding and run-up: it was ascertained that the tsunami caused many victims (the exact number is unknown, due to the catastrophic effects of the earthquake) and severe damage to buildings, ships, boats and nature. The tsunami involved mainly the eastern Sicily coast but also the southern and the northern ones.</p><p>At Messina the first sea movement was an ingression. The wave inundated many places causing severe damage to harbor infrastructures, boats and houses. All piers in the harbor lowered and some of them collapsed. Most damage in the southern beach of the city, close to the Portalegna stream. The english cemetery was completely destroyed. Many boats were carried onshore and destroyed. Many vessels moored in the harbor felt a sudden considerable sea level rise just a few minutes after the shock, and some of them broke their mooring.

In places the waves rose as high as 75 feet. \r\nMiyabe investigated the times of arrival of the waves as recorded on mareograms. At such distant points as San Francisco, Honolulu, Iquique, times of arrival check well enough for a wave starting from the earthquake epicenter at\r\nabout the time calculated as origin time from seismograms (which is good to within a very few seconds). However, the times recorded at Japanese tide stations are in part anomalous; at some of the more distant stations the tsunami was actually recorded as beginning 20 minutes earlier than at the nearest ones. This discrepancy may be due in part to seiches started by the seismic waves in the ground; Miyabe prefers to conclude that the tsunami probably did not originate from a point. In so great an earthquake, which almost certainly involved extensive faulting or block movement, this is to be expected. Omote proposes that there was an earlier wave originating around the margin of an area several hundred kilometers wide and a later wave from a more limited source of the order of 10 kilometers in diameter. An interesting detail was the recording at tide stations in Australia and New Zealand of waves, reflected from the American coast, traveling twice across the Pacific in about 47 hours. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote>Reference #3909:</blockquote> \r\n<p>In Japan there was a great disaster in Iwate province\r\nfrom both earthquake and tidal wave, with reported loss\r\nof 1535 lives, 2000 wounded, 7930 houses, 1570 boats, and\r\nmillions of dollars of property damage at the ports of\r\nKamaishi, Miyako, Yamoto and Omoto. \r\n</p><table><tbody><tr><td><br /><b><h2>Different Reports of Effects</h2></b>\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td>\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td valign=\"bottom\"><b>Deaths</b></td><td valign=\"bottom\"><b>Missing</b></td><td align=\"center\"><b>Houses<br />Washed Away</b></td><td align=\"center\"><b>Houses<br />Destroyed</b></td><td valign=\"bottom\"><b>Reference #</b></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Severe damage</td><td></td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td align=\"middle\">1,522</td><td>1,542</td><td>4,034</td><td>1,817</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td align=\"middle\">3,000</td><td></td><td>6,000</td><td></td><td>414</td></tr><tr><td align=\"middle\">2,986</td><td></td><td>4,086</td><td></td><td>1068</td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>",

Unusually high flood tides occurred on February 2 and 3. Gutenberg, Richter (1954): 30.1; 2h18m27s; 6.5 S., 155.5 E.; M&#61;7.8.</p>",

        "comments": "The magnitude 9.0 Mw earthquake off the east coast of Kamchatka generated a 13-meter wave locally. The waves struck the Hawaiian Islands at 1:00 pm. Property damage from these waves in the Hawaiian Islands was estimated at $800,000 to $1,000,000; however no lives were lost. It also caused damage on the west coast of the United States and was observed on tide gauges throughout the Pacific Basin.\r\n<p>Reference #79 lists considerable damage and considerable loss of life in the Kuril Islands.\r\n</p><p>The waves of the tsunami of 4-5 November 1952 were noted from Iturup l. on the south (height of wave 2.5 m.) to the village of Shubertovo near Ust&#39;-Kamchatsk (wave height 0.5-1 m.) and had destructive force over an extent of more than 700 km. of the Pacific coast -- from Onekotan l. on the south to the Kronotsky Peninsula (Kamchatka) on the north. The morphology of the shores and the relief of the bottoms of bays and straits played an important role in the heightening of the waves upon their arrival at the coast; waves which were imperceptible to ships on the open ocean, at the coast transformed themselves into terrible battering rams, which not only destroyed installations but changed the coastal relief, washing away sandy soils and causing landslides... The greatest destruction and suffering of 4-5 November were caused by the tsunami which arose as a result of the earthquake and which took in about 700 km of the east coasts of Kamchatka and the Kuril Is. On the average the height of the waves on the coast reached 6-7 m. In Kamchatka and on the Kuril Is. destructive sea waves appeared 30-40 minutes after the earthquake. At most points the beginning phase of the waves was accompanied by a lowering of the level of the ocean. Hence it follows that\r\nthe actual moment of appearance of the waves on the coast occurred half a period earlier. (reference #4252)\r\n</p><p>Kurilske was about 15 thousand inhabitants, about 4 thousand perished, extensive destruction... (reference #9224)\r\n</p><p> Because of the absence of casualties in the far field, this event was often perceived as involving a deceptive\r\ntsunami, as no reports were available from the near field. The 1952 Kamchatka tsunami was, in fact, a closely\r\nguarded state secret in the then-USSR, especially since we now know that it had eradicated the sensitive naval\r\nbase at Severo-Kuril&#39;sk. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, information started to slowly trickle out\r\nin the form either of dissemination abroad of existing reports or of studies resulting from new research into this matter. Among the latter, Smyshlyaev (reference #11472) reported 7,802 civilian deaths in the Northern Kurils, and estimated that the total death toll in the city of Severo-Kuril&#39;sk, including military casualties, must have reached 10,000 and perhaps as high as 17,000, making the event by far the deadliest tsunami in the twentieth century. (reference #9223)\r\n</p><p>). Present day estimates based on the existed  data on population density in the area and available damage reports from some selected coastal locations show that  minimum number of victims was about 4000 people with estimated maximum as high as 14000 fatalities (Smyshlyaev, 2003). Based on this, the most realistic estimate for the fatality level can be adopted as 10,000 people, the majority of which (more than 99%) were killed by tsunami. (reference #11763)\r\n</p><p>The source of 1952 earthquake was located in two time zones. According to Greenwich (UTC), the earthquake happened on November 4 at 16 hours 58 minutes. In Kamchatka (&#43;12 hours) at this time was November 5, 4-58 am, and in Kuril Islands, which live in Sakhalin time (&#43;11 hours) was 3-58 am. So, local people from Severo-Kurilsk use the time 4 am for the earthquake (reference #12048)\r\n</p><p>View a calculated <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu_travel_time.shtml#Kam1952\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tsunami-travel-time map</a>.</p>",

The earthquake occurred at night, and awoke only about 10 to 20% of the people. About 30 to 40 minutes after the earthquake, the waves (three distinct waves) began to arrive. Most of the people were still sleeping when the wave arrived, and the mostly-straw houses were washed away.\r\nAbout <b>223 people were killed, 15 were listed as missing, and 423 injured</b>. The tsunami <b>destroyed 1,500 homes, and 278 boats</b>. The most affected districts were Lumajang, Jember, and Banyuwangi. Most of the fatalities and damage was caused by a tsunami at the villages of Pancer, Lampon, and Rajekwesi in the Banyuwangi district, the most eastern of the districts.\r\n<p>At Pancer, an important village situated on sand dunes of a river mouth into the bay, more than 70% of the 1,000 buildings were destroyed but only 4% (122 people) of the 3,000 inhabitants were killed, and 15 were missing. All of the straw houses were destroyed, and most of the brick buildings were severely damaged. The second wave was the largest and penetrated 300 meters inland. Palm trees\r\nbetween the village and the sea helped to mitigate the wave damage although most were uprooted. The maximum runup height was 9.5 meters. The wave advanced up the river causing lateral flooding. One boat was carried 60 meters inland.\r\n</p><p>Lampon, the most eastern of the villages surveyed, had a population of 700 inhabitants before the tsunami. There were 35 fatalities and 40 straw houses destroyed some of which were 500 meters inland. The wave destroyed houses 500 meters inland. Most of the damage occurred near the river where there was significant erosion. The wave penetrated one km along the river. A maximum wave height of eleven meters was measured over a steep bank.\r\n</p><p>At Rajekwesi there were 1,200 inhabitants and 300 homes. Seventy percent of the homes were built with straw.

It had heights of 1.5 to 4.0 meters along the northern Mindoro coast. One effect was the breaking loose of a moored, 4,000-ton barge in the Baruyan River sweeping it 1.6 km upstream. The wave penetrated upstream about two kilometers.

It generated a tsunami that arrived at Eratini immediately after the earthquake. It had a runup height of 0.4-0.5 meters after a withdrawal of one meter a few minutes after the earthquake for a wave height (range) of 1.5 meters. (reference #1315)\r\n</p><p>On 15 June 1995, 00:16 GMT, a strong (Ms&#61;6.0) earthquake ruptured the western side of the Corinthos Gulf. The earthquake caused extensive damage in several towns and villages along both coastlines of the Gulf, the northern and the southern ones. The maximum intensity (VII&#43;) was felt in the city of Aegion, southern coastline, where the collapse of two multi-storied buildings caused a death toll of 26. Extensive coastal ground breaks and subsequent ground submergence were reported in both coastlines. In the northern coastline, a local tsunami wave was officially reported from the town of Eratini (peak-to-trough 1.5 m) being located in the epicentral area. The wave was observed immediately after the earthquake occurrence. Its maximum vertical run-up was of about 004-0.5 m, while a water withdrawal of about 1 m occurred a few minutes after the earthquake. The water disturbance lasted for about 12 hours. Damage was not reported. Judging from that no tsunami was reported from other coastal places of the epicentral or more remote areas it is tentatively concluded that the wave could be attributed to the reported massive sliding in the sea of unconsolidated sediments accumulated at the local river mouth. A similar mechanism of tsunamigenesis at the same place was considered in association with the earthquake (Ms&#61;6.3) of 6 July 1965. Tsunami generation from either seismic or aseismic sliding of coastal or submarine sediment masses is rather frequent in the Greek Archipelago, including the Gulf of Corinthos.

Given the large size of the two earthquakes occurring on November 16, it has been difficult to determine which seismic event caused what runup, as flooding and tsunami waves have been reported as inundating several coastlines. These include, unconfirmed reports of runup on the islands of Bougainville (Torokina reporting 2.5 to 3 m. runup) and Buka. In addition, it was reported a tsunami reaching Trobriand Islands (SW Solomon Sea) measured .3-1 meter. According to Rabaul Volcano Observatory (e-mail correspondence, Dec. 1, 2000) initial indications were that only the first large earthquake (4:55 UTC) caused a tsunami. But after reference to tide gauge records, it appeared most likely that it was the second earthquake (7:42 UTC) that created a tsunami. The inundation of a hardware store in Rabaul, occurring 20-30 minutes following the first earthquake, was most likely caused by a seiche. Runup of .9 meter was reported in\r\nRabaul. Because it was dark by the time the aftershock occurred it was difficult to verify when some coastlines were inundated. Follow-up confirmation reports and tide gage records have yet to be received. (reference #9795)\r\n<p>A magnitude 8.2 earthquake (04:54 UT) New Ireland, Papua New Guinea generated a damaging local tsunami at Kokopo and Rabaul, New Britain.

Tsunami damage was also observed along the southwestern coast of New Ireland, the west coast of Bougainville and on Buka. It was not certain whether the tsunami was the result of this earthquake or the aftershock that occurred a few hours later.

Run up heights on open coast were generally less than 1 m, but reached 1.5 m at Kauk and an estimated \r\n3-4 m in west-facing bays on the islands, and on the mainland coast immediately east of Boiken.\r\nThe higher run-up in the west-facing bays was a funneling effect. In both Victoria Bay and Mushu Bay, the larger of the west-facing bays on Mushu Island, observers saw the water circulate counter clockwise around the perimeter of the bay, and reach maximum height in the eastern extremity of each bay. Logs were washed ashore amongst the houses at Buruwan on Victoria Bay and 50 m of land was inundated. Logs, coral and a moored dinghy were washed ashore in Mushu Bay. The reason for the higher run-up east of Boiken is less clear, but perhaps was due to the funneling of the tsunami between the coast and the islands. Tsunami effects were observed as far east as Murik Lakes; where water washed through the villages at ankle depth. The villages are on a low sand bar. In the west, a repeated rising and falling of the water level in the Aitape River of the order of 1 m above normal water level was observed at 6.45 to 7 am. In Wewak too, there was a fluctuation of the sea level at 6:45-7 am, the water draining out into the bay then returning passively to flood across the road, before subsiding to normal level. The drop in sea level was estimated to be 2 m, and the rise above normal sea level, 1.5-2 m. The fluctuations at 6:45 am appear to have been a second and discrete tsunami event.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11914:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>It is notable that the amplitude and effects of the tsunami  were greatest in the Boiken - Muschu Is. - Kairiru Is. area, about 70-80 km from the epicenter of the main earthquake and about 20-30km from the location of the CMT. In the area of maximum damage from earthquake shaking, between Boiken and the mouth of Hawain River, the tsunami was reported to have had turbulent, violent flow. At Victoria Bay at the eastern end of Kairiru Island, the tsunami was observed to approach from the southwest and swirled along the cost with an anti-clockwise motion depositing large logs and other debris. At these locations and on both northern and southern coasts of Muschu Island houses were swept away by the tsunami. These observations indicate that source of the tsunami was in this same general area, ie., the Boiken - Muschu Is. - Kairiru Is. area.\r\n</p><p>2002, September 8, 18:44:25.53 UTC. 3.260 South,  142.940 East, depth 13.0 km, 7.6 Mw HRV.

A tsunami with a maximum estimated wave height of 2 m caused damage to boats in the Balearic Islands, Spain, especially in Puerto de Mahon, where 10 boats sank. It was recorded on tide gauges at Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Nice, France; and Genoa, Italy. The tsunami was also observed on the coast of Alicante, Castellon and Murcia, Spain. (reference #1053)\r\n<p>Observed tsunami waves of up to 3-m height with a mean period of 10-12 minutes were reported on the southeastern coast of Majorca and Menorca, and in Ibiza in the Spanish Balearic Islands located about 250 km north of the epicentral region. The waves caused significant damage to hundreds of vessels in harbors and ports. On the Algerian coast in the epicentral region, eyewitness accounts report a 100-m recession of the sea in coastal sections of Algiers and Boumerdes, and fishermen in the port of Zemmouri-El-Bahri, reported a drop in water depth to less than 1 m with several boats ending up resting on the sea bottom before the water returned. Underwater telephone cables were severed by the earthquake and/or tsunami cutting communications between Europe and Asia, the Middle East, and the Pacific. (reference #3025)\r\n</p><p>The destructive Zemmouri earthquake of 2003 May 21 (Mw 6.8) occurred at 18:44 (GMT) along the coast, 50 km east of the city of Algiers, between the cities of Zemmouri and Boumerd\u00e8s. This shock, the largest felt in this region since the 1716 event, had the epicenter  located very close to the coast (about 4 km) and the earthquake produced severe damage and more than 2,000 victims. Two main phenomena were associated to the earthquake: shoreline uplift along 50 km and a tsunami, triggered either by the earthquake itself or by a submarine landslide. According to Dr. Yelles, director of the CRAAG center in Algiers, the tsunami waves were generated by a river sediment slide. In fact, the area is well known for a large sediment deposited by a river, a deposit which is highly unstable. Instantaneously with the Zemmouri earthquake, a tsunami was generated along the northern Algerian coasts. No run-up values were reported along the Algerian coasts, indicating that the tsunami waves, if any, were not high enough to inundate beyond original shoreline. \r\n(reference #4139)\r\n</p><p>A strong tsunami with sea disturbances observed along the Algerian coast, but with significant damage mainly in the Balearic Islands (Spain) harbours, affected the western Mediterranean following the 2003 Zemmouri earthquake (MW 6.9, Algeria). An average regional uplift of 0.55 m was measured along the shoreline in the epicentral area. Field observations, main shock and aftershocks characteristics are consistent with thrust along a \u223c55-km-long rupture, trending NE-SW, dipping SE. The seismotectonic parameters indicate a hypocentre 7-8 km deep and a possible fault break between 5 and 15 km offshore. Several tide gauges located in the western Mediterranean Coast indicated an average of 0.4 m of sea-level change with a maximum of 2 m in the Balearic Islands. (reference #12057)</p>",

There was a very strong earthquake, which affected all Ambon Island and adjacent islands and left human victims...</p><p>Immediately after the earthquake, a tsunami occurred on the entire coast of Ambon Island. The northwestern shore of Hitu peninsula suffered most of all, especially the region of Ceyt, between Lima (Negrilima) and Hila. Here the water rose 80-100 m that is, to the top of the coastal hills. The trees, including those in the clove plantations, which covered the calcareous coastal slopes at Mamala, Ela, Sinalo, Kaitetto, Ceyt, Loboleu, almost as far as Lima, were uprooted. Only the higher-lying plantations at Nausihola, Wakal and Hitulama escaped destruction.</p><p>Everything was so &#34;jumbled&#34; onshore that it was unrecognizable. In the region of Loboleu, a coastal strip with the width of a musket shot subsided. The shore became very precipitous between Cety and Hila and at Hila itself, part of the coast also collapsed into the water, carrying with it the settlements of Nukali, Ehalaa, and Wawani. In all, 2243 people died on Ambon island as a result of the tsunami.</p><p>According to eyewitness accounts, the water rose up like a mountain. First it inundated Loboleu, and then it split into three streams. One of them spread along the coast to the west to Lima and Urien, another to the east to Hila, and the third went out to sea, in the direction to Cape Ryst on Ceram Island, carrying with it trees, houses, domestic livestock and people. The movements of the water were accompanied by a very loud nose. The moving water was black, very dirty and evil smelling; its surface phosphoresced.</p><p>According to the eyewitnesses, the surface of the sea in the strait between Ceram and Ambon Islands, was calm, and it was agitated and made a deafening noise only off shore, to the distance of a musket shot. People in a boat not far from shore did not notice anything unusual in the state of the sea; the oscillations in its surface were just as weak and small as usual. On the coast, all the proas and other boats were smashed or carried away by the water. Many fish were tossed up on land.</p><p><i>Ref #40 and #132:</i><br />1674, Feb. 17.

However, no attempt has been made to investigate this event further, particularly to answer why the extreme run-up was observed only on the northern coast of Ambon. Therefore, the primary source of the tsunami and earthquake remains open to question [...] More significantly, we have shown that the only way to explain the extreme run-up only on the northern shore of Ambon, and in particular the very narrow lateral extent along the coast over which it occurred, is by attributing the tsunami generation to a submarine landslide.</p>",

(ref #1053)\r\n</p><p>This was a \u0091slow earthquake&#39;, meaning that the rupture occurred more slowly and took longer than in a normal earthquake. Slow earthquakes usually occur at very shallow depths and produce greater displacements than normal earthquakes. As a consequence, they are more likely to significantly displace the seabed and generate tsunamis. In addition, the magnitude of slow earthquakes may be underestimated by traditional magnitude calculations because the energy they radiate is deficient in high frequencies due to the slower rupture speed. Further, the strongest energy release of the earthquake may occur minutes after the initial rupture and thus not be captured by the initial magnitude calculation. This event was also called a \u0091tsunami earthquake,&#39; which is an earthquake that generates a tsunami much larger than expected given the earthquake magnitude. \u0091Tsunami earthquakes&#39; are often caused by \u0091slow earthquakes&#39;.

Ambraseys (ref#15) and Ambraseys (ref#3845) relate this tsunami to the coasts of Lebanon and Israel. Amiran (ref#10419) suggest that the tsunami occurred on Jan 4, 1034, in Jaffa, and that the port of Akko fell dry for an hour. Soloviev (ref#2130) mention that tidal waves were observed in Gaza and Ashkelon, and that the seaport of Akko became dry for a long time and then it was half destroyed by a wave. Guidoboni (ref#10420) interpret that the tsunami effect is confined to Acre, but it is reasonable to suppose that the tsunami affected more of the coast. Ambraseys (ref#9116) constrains the tsunami to Acre and suggests that it did not cause damage or loss of life inland. Shalem (ref#10422), however, suspects this description might have been duplicated from the 1068 event. Following the detailed analysis of Ambraseys (ref#3845) and Guidoboni (ref#10420), the tsunami can be constrained to the northern and central coasts of Israel only.<p>Regarding the cause of the tsunami, Amiran (ref#10419) mention a swarm of earthquakes during the winter of 1033/4, probably in the Jordan Valley, including the strongest shock on 1033 12 10 and another one on 1034 01 04. Ambraseys (ref#10421) and Ambraseys (ref#3845) also locate the earthquake in the Jordan Valley but date it on 1033 12 05. A detailed analysis by Guidoboni (ref#10420) suggests that the earthquake occurred on 1033 12 05, although Arabic sources give the date of 1033 12 05 as 1034 01 04. In their opinion, Perrey (ref#10418) dated this event to 1032 03 06, which is then further confused with 1033 03 06, the date of the earthquake that occurred in Constantinople. </p><p>(above from ref #10416)</p><p>1033, Dec 5. A damaging earthquake occurred in Palestine... In Acre the sea flowed out several kilometres before flowing back as a wave an hour later. Although it drowned some of those who were foraging on the seabed, there is no evidence that it caused destruction or loss of life inland.( ref #9116)</p><p>1032.

In Syria, 1/3 of Ramala was destroyed. In Jerusalem the walls collapsed and the temple was severely destroyed. In Ghaza the mosque and its minarets at El Gaalan were destroyed also upper part of lighthouse badly damaged. In Nablus 1/2 of the city fell down, many villages in El Badou were swallowed up in the ground. In Egypt the earthquake caused much damage. There were 70,000 victims. (ref #1222)</p><p>1034, Jan. 4.

A strong destructive earthquake occurred in the vast region from Syria in the northeast to Egypt in the southwest. Half of the city of Nablus and 1/3 of the city of Ramallah were destroyed. In Jerusalem, walls were destroyed, the temple was badly damaged, other buildings suffered damage. In Gaza the mosque and the lighthouse were damaged, heavy damage was caused in Ashkelon. After one or several earthquakes the sea retreated from the shore and returned swiftly. Tidal waves were observed in Gaza and in Ashkelon. The seaport of Akko became dry for a long time, then it was half destroyed by a wave. (ref #2130)</p><p>1035, April or May. From the study of the available information on these individual earthquakes, it appears that there are at least four major distinct earthquakes that occurred between 1033 and 1035 AD. A third very strong earthquake occurred in April or early May 1035 AD and damaged the northern provinces of Syria. It appears that the April or May 1035 AD earthquake was responsible for the seismic sea-wave. During this earthquake, extensive faulting and probably some crustal deformation occurred in the Saida-Sur area. (ref #26)</p>",

Many houses collapsed causing a large number of deaths, and in many places large cracks opened into the ground, and clefts were formed. The sea overwhelmed many cities (Gallieni, lib. v, Q 2-6). Trebellius says also that these earthquakes occurred while a great pestilence raged in the east. The pestilence, which is also mentioned by Eusebius (Eccles. History, lib. vii, Q 22) together with the fact that at that time Gallienus was consul, fixes the time of this event in 262 AD. It does not seem certain that these earthquakes happened at the same time in Asia Minor and in Lybia. Nor that the inundations alluded to by Pollio took place in Asia Minor.

Mud and ashes cover the surrounding country to a depth of six inches. An American school teacher has notified the Government officials here that all of the small villages on the western shoes of Lake Taal were overwhelmed by the tidal wave.

Thus, as for the 1754 Plinian eruption, a pyroclastic flow mechanism is more likely (Delos Reyes et al. 2018). However, atmospheric shock waves generated by the strongest explosions (Pratt 1911) are another possible source mechanism of the tsunamis. Moore et al. (1966) also related the tsunamis observed during the 1965 eruption to shock waves, although the transfer of energy from air to water (or phase-coupling) operates mostly on large areas of deep water (Yokoyama 1987), i.e., larger and deeper than Taal Caldera Lake.

At the latitude of the earthquake of September 29, 2009, the Pacific plate moves westward with respect to the interior of the Australia plate at a velocity of about 86 mm/year. The earthquake occurred near the northern end of a 3,000 km long segment of the Pacific/Australia plate boundary that trends north-northeast; farther north of the earthquake&#39;s source region, the plate boundary trends northwest and then west. The eastern edge of the broad Australia plate may be viewed as a collection of small plates or microplates that move with respect to each other and with respect to the Pacific plate and the Australia plate interior.\r\n</p><p>On the basis of currently available location and fault mechanism information, we infer that the September 29 earthquake occurred as a normal fault rupture on or near the outer rise of the subducting Pacific plate.\r\n</p><p>The broad-scale Australia/Pacific plate boundary is one of the most active earthquake regions in the world. Earthquakes occur on the thrust-fault boundary between the Australia and Pacific plates, within the Pacific plate on both sides of the trench, and within and on the boundaries of the small plates that compose the eastern edge of the overall Australia plate.\r\n</p><p>(above from ref #1053)\r\n</p><p>Out of the 35 deaths in American Samoa (including 33 confirmed deaths &amp; 2 missing persons), 13 over the age of 60 and 3 under the age of 10. At least 5 did not speak English. (ref #7397 &amp; 12402)\r\n</p><p>Samoa: The official death toll stands at 143, with five people missing. An estimated 4,500 people have been  directly affected by the tsunami, most of who are displaced.\r\nTonga: Nine people died and seven were seriously injured as a result of the tsunami that struck the northern island of Niuatoputapu. The Government has released its disaster assessment report and estimates the total cost of damage as <b>Tongan Pa&#39;anga 18.2 million (approximately US$9.5 million</b>).\r\n(ref #8715)\r\n</p><p>148 killed, 5855 affected, $150 million damage.

Economic losses are estimated conservatively at US$200 million... The most substantial damage [in American Ssmos] was wrought in the village of Poloa, where waves destroyed all structures except the church, which was itself severely damaged.

Preliminary measures of a Rapid Survey Team deployed the week after the event by UNESCO showed run-up measurements as high as 30 m with most common measurements between 6 and 10 m in the most affected area of the Chilean coast. (reference #9405)</p><p>The tsunami is believed responsible for much of the deaths and damage. The magnitude-8.8 quake - one of the strongest on record - and the tsunami that followed ravaged a 435-mile stretch of Chile&#39;s Pacific coast. In the coastal town of Constitucion, firefighters were looking for bodies of people swept away by the tsunami as they camped on Isla Orrego, an island in the mouth of the Maure River that flows through the city. Constitucion suffered perhaps the greatest loss of life in the disaster, in part because many people had come for carnival celebrations and were caught in huge waves that reached the central plaza. &#34;There were about 200 people in tents who disappeared&#34; on Isla Orrego, Fire Chief Miguel Reyes told The Associated Press. (ref. #6836)</p><p>Yet a large wave crashed later into the Chilean islands of Juan Fernandez, killing at least 8 people and leaving another 8 missing, the emergency office said. (ref. #6810)</p><p>While the Pacific basin was spared a major tsunami, there was major tsunami damage in Chile. In the coastal city of Talcahuano, where the surge reached nearly 5 m from peak to trough, a bizarre exchange took place: While even larger boats landed in the city centre, entire homes floated out to sea. &#39;The water swept aside everything that got in its way,&#39; said a resident of the small town of Boyecura. A wall of water swept across the Chilean island of Robinson Crusoe, 670 km off the coast, destroying many buildings and sweeping 5 people out to sea. Eleven others were missing. The Chilean Navy admitted it failed to give adequate tsunami warning to Robinson Crusoe, which lies in the Chilean archipelago of Juan Fernandez. (ref. #6811)</p><p>Islanders in the Chilean archipelago of Juan Fernandez felt a slight tremor early Saturday, one just like any other of those they hardly take notice of, and they slept on. Over the course of the morning, they saw on television the damage that the massive quake had caused in the city of Concepcion and elsewhere on the southern Chilean mainland. And then officials started waiting for information about a possible tsunami, but it ever came. Instead, as they saw the sea starting to rise, they rushed to switch on the sirens - but it was too late for some. The tsunami killed 5 people on the island, while 14 remained missing a day later, a toll that may have been avoided had the tsunami-detection and warning mechanisms been in order, some say. Upon hearing the sirens, some of the 629 residents of the village of Juan Bautista on Robinson Crusoe Is ran to the hills with no time for salvage. A wall of water - possibly nearly 5 metres high - ravaged everything in its way. Within a few minutes, the scene of the adventures of Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk - marooned on the island from 1704 to 1708, and immortalized in Daniel Defoe&#39;s novel Robinson Crusoe - had been razed to the ground. &#34;Everything that had been along that three-km stretch just disappeared,&#34; said Fernando Avaria, the first pilot to fly over the area after the disaster. The cemetery, the churches, sports facilities and the area&#39;s only school were reduced to planks of wood and broken glass. The buildings of the local authority simply disappeared. &#34;It was devastating, really out of a horror film,&#34; said Margot Salas, a local who toured the area with Chilean state television cameras almost 24 hours after the disaster. As the sea receded, Robinson Crusoe Is faced a new flood - one of despair. Mud covered everything within 3 km of the coast. (ref. #6812)</p>",

Sea withdrawal along the coast in the Gulf of Naples. On December 17 at about midday a great earthquake (40 deg 49 min N 14 deg 26 min E) occurred and a large crack on the flank facing the sea caused a huge flow; in the meantime the sea withdrew for three times and then inundated the beach furiously. Near Sorrento the sea withdrew about 1 mile. (reference #4139)\r\n<p>1631 (1630), December 17. Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy, Bay of Naples. Earthquake  40 deg 50 min N, 14 deg 25 min E, intensity VII, tsunami intensity v, event validity 2. The earthquake occurred in Naples; Vesuvius erupted during the preceding night. After the earthquake, the sea near Naples, Sorrento, Island of Nisida and on the Island of Ischia receded from the coast by 1,000 yards (according to other data, by 100 yards), ships ran aground; then, part of them were thrown out onto the dry land and left there far away from the coast, some ships were wrecked. The level of the water near the fortress walls in Civitavecchia decreased by three palms of the hand. (reference #2130)\r\n</p><p>The most significant of these tsunamis seems to be that occurred in December 1631 during the great Vesuvian eruption (16-18 December) that was observed in the entire Gulf of Naples from Ischia to Sorrento and that began with a remarkable water withdrawal of more than 1000 yards followed by waves invading the coasts deep inland[...] The tsunami is depicted in the chronicles by Braccini (1632) and Giuliani (1632) who gave reports rather consistent with each other as regards the event time, the water first receding and then invading the coast three times, the vessels damaged and the boats destroyed[...] The generation mechanism of the Vesuvian tsunamis is not easy to define. There is no obvious relationship between the eruption magnitude and the magnitude of the ensuing tsunami[...] The hypothesis of a tsunami induced by an earthquake associated with the eruptive phases is not convincing too, since there is no sound evidence that the 1631 was immediately preceded by a shock the size needed to generate a tsunami. Subaerial or submarine landslides can be excluded. (reference #3347)\r\n</p><p>The cause- effect relationship between eruptive phenomena and the tsunami is not clear. However, the retreat of the waters did not seem to be linked to the nuees ardentes entering the sea, because authors reported that the nuees ardentes overflow from the crater was strictly contemporaneous with sea withdrawal.

        "comments": "An unusually high tidal wave was observed on the coast of the Kii Peninsula and at Ozuchi (Iwate Prefecture). There are no reports about an earthquake. Was this a tsunami of remote origin. (Reference #414, first published in Russian, 1974). Reference #150 lists the source of the tsunami that attacked Otsuchi as off Miyagi Prefecture.<p>\r\n</p><p>A Pacific tsunami flooded Japanese shores in January 1700. The waters drove villagers to high ground, damaged salt kilns and fishing shacks, drowned paddies and crops, ascended a castle moat, entered a government store house, washed away more than dozen buildings and spread flames that consumed twenty more. Return flows contributed to a nautical accident that sank tons of rice and killed two sailors. Samurai magistrates issued rice to afflicted villagers and requested lumber for those left homeless. A village headman received no advance warning from an earthquake; he wondered what to call the waves. (from p. 27 reference #2479)\r\n</p><p>Places flooded by the 1700 tsunami in Japan include Kuwagasaki, Tsugaruishi, Otsuchi, Miho and Tanabe. Some of the accounts mention damage in additional villages. In one account, the tsunami takes the form of rough seas that initiate a nautical accident near Nakaminato. (from p. 33 reference #2479)\r\n</p><p>A trans-Pacific reunion took place in 1996. Orphaned for nearly 300 years, the 1700 tsunami in Japan was reuinted, on the pages of a scientific journal, with an earthquake and tsunami in North America... The orphan dated the earthquake to the evening of January 26, 1700... and gave its approximate size as magnitude 9. (from p.93 reference #2479)\r\n</p><p>Today the 1700 tsunami is securely linked to a giant North American earthquake. The tie was strengthened in 1997 by tree-ring dating that narrowed the time window for a great Cascadia earthquake to the months between August 1699 and May 1700. The earthquake&#39;s enormity was confirmed in 2003 through improved estimates of the tsunami&#39;s size and from computer simulations of Cascadia earthquakes and of the tsunami itself... The tsunami&#39;s written record in Japan has become clearer too, with discovery in 1998 of the Miho headman&#39;s account, authentification in 2002 of the Nakaminato shipwreck certificate and explanation in 2004 of a discordant date from Tsugaruishi. (from p. 93 reference #2479)\r\n</p><p>The Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) is situated off of the Pacific Northwest coast of North America, from Northern California to Vancouver Island, British Columbia. (from reference #2480)\r\n</p><p>If the 1700 tsunami came from Cascadia, we can estimate the origin time and magnitude of the earthquake. The earliest documented tsunami arrival time was around midnight on 27 January Japan time, or around 15:00 on 27 January GMT. Because tsunami travel time from Cascadia to Japan is about 10 hours, the earthquake origin time is estimated at around 5:00 27 January GMT or 21:00 on 26 January local time in Cascadia. This time is consistent with Native American legends that an earthquake occurred on a winter night. (reference #2654)</p>",

The power of the tsunami was enough to wrench the house off its foundations, partially caved in two external walls, and rip off the deck and deposit it on the beach. The damage wasn&#39;t just caused by water, tree trunks and other debris were carried in the tsunami which reached 4.1 metres above mean sea level and traveled 140 metres up the river creek next to the cottage.(reference #11666)\r\nThe team surveyed the areas on December 9 - three-and-a-half weeks after the magnitude-7.8 Kaikoura earthquake, which struck just after midnight on November 14 wreaking massive landscape changes to North Canterbury and Marlborough. Findings were based on marine debris, such as logs, kelp, fish, crayfish and paua found well above where they would normally be expected. The tsunami was found to be highest at Goose Bay, with data indicating a maximum runup height above tide level at the time of the tsunami of 6.9m &#43; or - 0.3m.

Early on a summer morning in the early 1800s, a large landslide occurred at Camano Head, carrying standing trees to the beach, and burying many people living at the toe of the bluff. The landslide sounded like thunder and created large volumes of dust. The landslide also resulted in a tsunami that traveled south toward Hat Island, washing over the barrier beach, destroying houses or encampments and drowning many people.\r\n</p><p>The accounts make no mention of ground shaking, suggesting that the landslide was not associated with a major earthquake.\r\n</p><p>The Camano Head landslide is the only known example of a landslide on Puget Sound generating a tsunami large enough to cause significant loss of life.\r\n</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11942:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>One of the Snohomish villages was located beneath a bluff at the southern tip of Camano Island, Camano Head.

At first, \u0091it was theorized by some that construction activity in the harbor caused the initial landslide. However, this paper presents the findings of an in-depth scientific investigation that concludes that such a theory is impossible. The findings paint a clear picture of the failure of the submerged Skagway River delta that was overloaded by flood sediments and exacerbated by river diking. Slide volumes estimated at over 20,000,000 cubic yards that consisted of a massive initial slide and subsequent retrogressive earth slides produced the tsunami that caused the fatality and destroyed or damaged harbor structures. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1315:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>A negative tide of 1.2 m at 7:10 pm local time was the probable cause of a submarine landslide-generated tsunami that caused about $25 million damage and one fatality in Skagway Harbor, Alaska.

After a period of extraordinary activity of the volcano of Stromboli which started in Feb, its powerful explosion occurred with a noise of unprecedented intensity and with the discharge of enormous puffs of black smoke that enveloped the entire island for a short time. Anyone trying to move was knocked down. The explosion was accompanied by water being blown up from the sea and flooding the coast, everything around was overturned, and all the ships were carried approximately 300m up to vineyards adjacent to the coast. The tsunami waves were generated (evidently, owing to a sudden increase of the atmospheric pressure). &#34;The displacement of water, like during a weak tsunami, was observed on the Island of Ustica. First, a whirlpool appeared in the sea in the Piccolo Lagoon of the Island of Capri, i.e. in the part of the island facing the Island of Stromboli, and reefs usually covered with water were uncovered for 1 m, and then, 6-7 s later, powerful waves gushed over the normal water line. Oscillations of the sea level of a very low amplitude (0.5 cm) with a period of about 11 min were recorded by the tide gauge stalled at the lighthouse [Faro] near Messina after l8h and lasted 90 min; they resumed half an hour later and lasted 30 min more. The tide gauge in Messina recorded usual sea waves with a period of 7-8 min, but of a low amplitude - about 1 cm, 2 cm maximum - during the eruption. Oscillations of a much higher amplitude started approximately at 18h, and the amplitude reached 7.5 cm 20min later; after that, the waves caused by the eruption started to subside, but continued about 3 hours more. No signs of tsunami in the records of the tide gauges in the towns of Palermo, Catania, Cagliari (Sardinia Is), Naples, on the Island of Ischia, in the town of Civitavecchia were revealed.

There was a powerful eruption of the Awu Volcano on Sangihe Island, which generated, so far as can be judged from the fragmentary data, joint gravitational oscillations of the atmosphere and the hydrosphere of the same type as the waves from the Krakatau explosion and corresponding oscillations in level [seiche type?] in the internal seas in Indonesia.</p><p>The eruption began at 18:10 without any preliminary phenomena. A huge column of smoke rose over the volcano. Lightning flashed. It rained with a mixture of ashes. This soon became a real ash and rock fall.\r\n</p><p>The explosion of the volcano was not accompanied by noticeable tremors of the island. The eruption reached extraordinary power at about 21:00. After this, the fall of pumice stopped, and the ashfall also diminished by midnight. Soon after the eruption, boiling mud flows saturated with hydrogen sulfide, presumably formed as a result of the emptying of the crater lake, rushed along the crevices which furrowed the slopes of the volcano. As a result of the eruption, <b>1,532 people died</b> on the island, or 2% of its population, since many huts collapsed under the weight of ejecta, while others were washed away by the streams. The northern part of the island suffered considerably more than the southern. Gardens, kitchen-gardens, and coconut plantations were buried.</p><p>The loud noises of the explosions of the volcano were heard on\r\nTernate Island from 18:00 to 22:00 and then at night until 2:00. At Manado, several explosions were heard for half an hour after 18:30, and flames flickered on the horizon to the north. At Tolitoli and Donggala, and also at many parts in the southern and eastern regions of Sulawesi Is. and on Kabia Island, including Makassar and Maros and on Timor\r\nIsland, at 19:30 and later, very faint muffled booms were heard, like distant artillery fire. Similar sounds were heard at 20:30 at Ambon and at night on Flores Is., at Larantuka.</p><p>The sound wave was followed by a gravitation wave, which caused perceptible tremors at a number of places. Prolonged faint trembling of the ground was felt in the evening on Ternate Is. At Makassar at 1:57, tremors 3-4 degrees in strength were registered. Similar oscillations were registered at Maros and in general in the southern and eastern regions of Sulawesi Is. and on Kabia Is. At Bima, on Sumbawa Is., very strong horizontal oscillations were felt from 2:05 to 2:15, and very weak [ground] waves were felt at 5:10 and at 8:10. Several huts collapsed on Flores Is. at Reo. At Maumere, horizontal oscillations lasting 2 minutes were felt at 2:30; one hut collapsed. At Ende, strong oscillations were felt at 1:00. At Larantuka, horizontal tremors lasting 2 minutes were felt at 2:30; one residence collapsed.</p><p>At Surabaja at 1:34, the pendulum of the astronomical clock stopped.</p><p>At Djakarta (Batavia), the magnetograph registered an earthquake at 1:17 and then at 1:21 and 6:00.</p><p>Oscillations in sea level were noticed at Bonthain, Bulukumba and Salajar; the only consequence was minor damage to one boat in the Tanga River at Bonthain.</p><p>At Bima, oscillations in level were noticeable at 3:00. The water rose high at the entrance to the bay; this was accompanied by a loud noise, which was even heard in the home of the local superintendent, a 2-hour walk away. This rustling lasted 20 minutes, after which the water began to rise very quickly. The highest rise of water was observed at 5:00, when there should have been an ebb.</p><p>A weak tsunami was observed at 7:00 in Ambon Bay. In a few minutes, the water level oscillated from the highest to the lowest level, with a range of more than 1.5 m.\r\n</p><p>The ashes ejected during the explosion settled on a considerable area to the south of Sangihe Is. A ship traveling to Sangihe Is. from Ternate Is. was covered with ashes; ashes fell on Likupang. At Donggala and Makassar, much ash fell on the 8th from 3:00 until sunset.</p>",

Sizeable cracks appeared in the ground and landslides were also recorded, a river flowing from Lake Riniue became blocked in its upper reaches. The dam lasted until April of the following year, when after prolonged rains the water level in the lake rose considerably, causing the dam to burst and resulting in much devastation farther downstream; more than <b>1200 Indians perished</b> and many cattle were lost as well.\r\nThe earthquake caused a powerful tsunami in the area of Valdivia, located on a river of the same name about 25 km upstream from its mouth. The earth continued to shake for a quarter of an hour when the water came rushing upstream, reversing the natural flow of the river. The rising water knocked over houses, poles and uprooted trees. Two galleons, riding at anchor in this port were sunk (other accounts said they were washed up on shore). After the ebb, the inhabitants had time to flee to higher ground. <b>About a hundred Indian fishermmen were drowned</b> near the mouth of the Imperial River.\r\n<p>In Concepcion Bay, the tsunami caused no damage.

The town was inundated and the sea advanced inland. Where the town once was, is now a bay in which ships lie at anchor. The town was rebuilt 1 km from the ocean shore. According to other reports, all houses in the town were washed away, but the more solidly constructed fortifications stood up.

The aftershocks lasted till May (Stamatelos, 1870; Machaeras, 1951; Triantaphyllou, 1959; Tsitseles, 1960). This is considered by Stamatelos as the seventh destruction of Leukada since 1612.

The oscillations in level apparently began here with a\r\nsmall ebb tide. It was observed throughout the Pacific Basin including Samoa, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Mexico and California. The tsunami was observed at all the islands of the Hawaiian archipelago. The tsunami caused fatalities in Hawaii and Japan.

There was a destructive earthquake and catastrophic tsunami with source off the northern coast of Chile. This is sometimes mentioned in the literature as the Iquique tsunami. At Iquique at 20:20, a slight booming rumble was heard, accompanied by slow oscillations of the ground, which soon became terrible tremors lasting about 4 minutes. It was impossible to stand without holding on to something. A cloud of dust arose in the air. A fire was\r\nstarted by overturned lamps in the southern part of the city. However, it was soon extinguished. This earthquake was considered stronger than any previously felt in the city [7 degrees]. There was a similar earthquake at San Pedro, accompanied by a terrible rumble. Buildings were partially destroyed, and many inhabitants were confused, but no one died, since people had time to run from their homes [7-8 degrees]. Tarapaca, Mamina, Pica, La Horia, La Tarama, Conchones, and Punta Lobos were more or less destroyed [7]. At Caleta Pabellon de Pica, the earthquake lasted 5 minutes with increasing force. More than 10 fires were started by overturned lamps. The fires were extinguished by the flood. <b>Thirty-three workers died in a\r\nlandslide</b>. Furniture and lamps were overturned; fires broke out. Colossal chunks of rock fell from the mountain sides; cracks up to 15 m deep in places opened up in the ground.

Punta Arenas earthquake. A foreshock was felt at about 02:50 a.m. The intensity at Punta Arenas was around 7; no casualties occurred in the town itself. Most of the damage was due to the collapse of firewalls between wooden houses. No damage was reported from the oilfields on Tierra del Fuego Island. About 2 dozen aftershocks were felt the first day. Landslides occurred along the west coast of Tierra del Fuego, particularly at San Nicolas, in Admiralty Bay, and along the banks of lake Fagnano and the Belverde River. Three persons were killed at a lumber mill which was destroyed by a large landslide at San Nicolas, about 50 km south of Punta Arenas. Jets of salt water were reported squirting from the ground at that locality. Local tsunami waves and abnormally strong tidal currents were observed on Porvenir, in Admiralty Bay, in the Zigzag Channel near Gabriel Canal, and at other points. The epicenter was located presumably on tho fault structure which includes Lake Fagnano and the western arm of the Magellan Straits; but it was closer to Lake Fagnano than to Punta Arenas.

A large Tokachi-oki earthquake occurred at the southern coast of Hokkaido, Japan. The earthquake generated large tsunamis causing damage along the southern coast of Hokkaido. The largest tsunami height was 4 m to the east of Cape Erimo, around Bansei-onsen, and locally at Mabiro. The large tsunamis arrived at the Pacific side of the coast of Hokkaido and Tohoku about 2-3 hours after the time of the high tide. In general, the tsunami run-up heights were gradually decreased to the east and to the west away from those two places except Mabiro where the large tsunami height about 4 m is locally observed. The tsunamis generated by the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake were observed at tide gauges in eastern Hokkaido and the northern Tohoku regions. The large later phase observed at the tide gauge in Urakawa is the edge wave propagating from Cape Erimo along the west coast of the Hidaka area.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #3819:</i></blockquote>\r\nAt the Tokachi harbor, several cars parked at the quays were washed away by the tsunami. Tokachi harbor was one of the regions most damaged by the tsunami. At thirty survey points in Tokachi harbor, tsunami heights were 2.4-3.2m; these were mostly measured from water lines marked along the buildings or constructions by the tsunami.\r\n<p>The Ootsu harbor is one of the regions most damaged by the tsunami. Several ships collided or were washed away by the tsunamis. The most intensive tsunami survey was conducted in this region. At the northeastern end of the harbor, the tsunami heights were measured from water level lines left by the tsunami on the buildings and other structures. The tsunami heights in the Ootsu harbor ranged 1.8-3.3m, but mostly 2.4-2.9 m.\r\n</p><p>2003.9.25, Hokkaido Japan event has 1 death and 1 missing. (from Kyodo News of Japan, 2005, in Japanese).

Aegean Sea, eastern Greece. Island of Euboea, Gulf of Maliacus. Evidence provided by Thucidides indicates that a series of earthquakes occurred in the regions of Attica, Boeotia, Euboea in the autumn of 427 B.C. ... Several shocks in the summer and autumn of 426 B.C. occurred in the strait separating the Euboea Island from the continent. </p><p>According to eyewitness Demetrios Kallatianos, a significant part of the Lichades Island and the Cape Cenaeon sank under water. The shore near Orobies also sank and the coastal line shifted deep into dry land. The base of one of the peninsulas opposite the continental shore sank, and the Island of Atalanti appeared (Talantonissi). </p><p>After one of the earthquakes, the sea in Orobies retreated from the coastal line, but later on, coming back in the form of huge &#34;swelling&#34;, it partly flooded the settlement and this was repeated many times. According to Strabo, the waves flooded the shore three times, penetrating the continental coast of Greece 3-4 miles inland. Gullies in the vicinity of Tarfi, Thronium, Thermoplyles and Daphus were flooded, and many settlements were destroyed. A similar flood took place on the Atalanti Island: here, waves caught up triremes and dragged them along the shore for more than 2 miles; another trireme was torn away from a moorage and smashed against the walls. The sea also retreated from the coast in Peparithos and Skopelos, too, but no flood accompanied this process. The wave was observed in Opus near Kiparissi. On the eastern shore of Euboea Island no waves were observed. Judging from descriptions, a tectonic collapse occurred in the strait between the Euboea Island and the continent, resulting in great seiches. One must agree with Antonopoulos that possible local landslides of friable material were not the main cause of variations in the water level in the strait.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #4139:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>426 BC June, earthquake magnitude 7.1, intensity X, 38 deg 54 min N, 22 deg 42 min E, tsunami intensity v, event validity 4.

There was a very strong earthquake (4.25 S, 152.25 E) along the coast of Blanche Bay, including at Rabaul. It was barely felt on the Duke of York Islands (30 km east of Rabaul). The earthquake was accompanied by two tsunami waves, which washed out a large section of the coast of Matupi Island (according to other sources, the earthquake occurred two days before the tsunami). \r\n</p><p>Soon after the earthquake, clouds of steam could be seen rising out of the water along the line joining the Raluan Volcano and the Tawurwur (Ghaie) Volcano. An hour later, the old crater of the Ghaie Volcano exploded with &#34;terrible force.&#34; Flames and enormous masses of smoke and ashes were ejected. There were apparently <b>no lava flows</b>. A thick layer of ash and pumice covered the coast and Saint George&#39;s Channel. At Ghaie, a new cone was formed. At the site of the underwater eruption, a cone-shaped, but rather flat elevation 20 m high formed out of loose material. This later became Raluan (Baluan) Island. The eruption of the Raluan Volcano lasted three days, during which time total darkness reigned; fishes and turtles died. The eruption of the Ghaie Volcano lasted three weeks. Due to the prevailing northwest winds, the ejecta settled mainly in the sea, and on land only the regions immediately adjoining the volcanoes suffered. Blanche Bay and Saint George&#39;s Channel were plugged up with islands of floating pumice for a month.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #99:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1878, February 4. The eruption of 1878 is well described by both Dr. George Brown and Dr. Wilfred Powell. Dr. Brown writes that it was reported to him on the 30th January that the old volcano in Blanche was in eruption. On the other hand, in his description he says that on Sunday night, the 3rd February, very violent earthquakes were felt, followed by tidal waves on the Monday morning. Soon afterwards, clouds of steam were seen rising from the bay in a direct line between Tavurvur and Vulcan, and as the submarine crater increased in strength, these steam clouds ceased and the old crater burst out with terrific power. </p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #79:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1878, February.

Five Indians, who were on a small island near the foot of one of the glaciers, were drowned in the tidal wave caused by the falling ice&#34; (The Alaskan, Sitka, September 29, 1900, p. 4). The description sounds like a report by survivors. Miller (1960, p. 74) mentions a flood in Lituya Bay reported by fishermen to him in 1952. The flood destroyed a native fish saltery near the mouth of\r\nthe bay and occurred about 1899. There are three, not five, glaciers feeding Lituya Bay: Lituya, Cascade and North Crillon. There is only one permanent island in the bay, Cenotaph, but there is the possibility of small islands forming in the moraine material at the base of the\r\nglaciers.  (reference #239)",

At least 3 people killed and 7 missing due to a 7.6 meter tsunami caused by rockslides falling into a narrow fjord near Puerto Aisen. Felt (VII) at Puerto Aisen and Puerto Chacabuco, (VI) at Coihaique, (V) at Balmaceda and (IV) at Cochrane. (reference #1053) \r\n<p>The earthquake in the Region of Aysen generated landslides between the Island Mentirosa and Ri&#39;o Cuervo, generating a mass of earth that fell into the sea causing waves of great size that affected the coastal sectors and the salmon plants of the fiord of Aysen. Three people were killed and seven are missing. (ref #2684)\r\n</p><p>The earthquake produced a landslide in the fjord area close to Puerto Chacabuco. The landslide generated 3 waves, the biggest was about 6 meters and affected a local area. A tide gauge recorded only a 0.8 m. variation (10 km away from the landslide). (ref #2686)\r\n</p><p>On 21 April 2007, an Mw 6.2 earthquake produced an unforeseen chain of events in the Aysen fjord (Chilean Patagonia, 45.5 S). The earthquake triggered hundreds of subaerial landslides along the fjord flanks. Some of the landslides eventually involved a subaqueous component that, in turn, generated a series of displacement waves-tsunami- like waves produced by the fast entry of a subaerial landmass into a water body-within the fjord. These waves, with run-ups several meters high along the shoreline, caused 10 fatalities. In addition, they severely damaged salmon farms, which constitute the main economic activity in the region, setting free millions of cultivated salmon with still unknown ecological consequences... The combined results from all of these studies show that the large destructive waves were likely generated by the concurrent effects of the entry of subaerial landslides into the water body, the subaqueous destabilization of the fjord flanks linked to coastline retreat, and the sudden generation of the compressional ridges, which implied a vertical displacement of the fjord floor of up to 15 meters. (ref #10839)\r\n</p><p>April 1 (Ms 5,4) which triggered a small tsunami and caused some minor damages to the salmon farms near the epicentral zone. As a consequence, debris flows and tsunamis caused the death of three people and the disappearance of seven, in addition to severe damages to the salmon industry installations. The main areas affected by the tsunami were Punta Tortuga (one missing person), the mouth of R\u00edo Pescado, and Playa Blanca (Fig. 7; three dead and three missing people), the mouth of Rio Cuervo, Punta Camello (Caleta Dagny y Ensenada La Perra, one missing person), Isla Mentirosa, the mouths of Fr\u00edo and Fern\u00e1ndez rivers, Punta Yelcho, Caleta Bluff and Bahia Acantilada. <b>Note: reference #9790 clarifies that deaths were not all at this single location and that two deaths were due to landslides, not tsunami.</b>(ref #9790)\r\n</p><p>The displaced water masses formed swells estimated between 5 to 10 m in height for Aguas Calientes and probably more than 10 m for Isla Mentirosa, which seems to have been after the first wave. From these, in seconds, waves of tsunami were generated that reached speeds of radial propagation estimated between 360 and 600 km/h. The displaced waters left marks by direct impact of up to 50 m in the northern part of the Isla Mentirosa. The areas most impacted by the tsunami waves are: Punta Tortuga, mouth of Rio Pescado, Playa Blanca, mouth of Rio Cuervo, Punta Camello, Isla Mentirosa, estuary mouths of Frio and Fernandez, Punta Yelcho, Caleta Bluff and Bahia Acantilada.

        "comments": "1853-1854. Validity 4 with some uncertainty on the date. A massive wave in Lituya Bay cleared trees to a height of 120 meters.  The occurrence of the wave is evidenced by a well-marked zone in the forest on either shore of the bay, the demarcation line of which separates two tree populations of differing ages.  Growth ring dating of the younger, lower trees indicated that a wave had cleared the forest between the growing season of August 1853 and May 1854. It is believed that the wave was generated by a rockslide on the south shore of the bay.  The report of many drowned at Dry Bay between 1850 and 1860 is probably associated with this tsunami. Native histories variously suggest from 8-10 war canoes with 8 men each were lost, to the loss of an entire village, as possible results of this event. It is tempting to combine these events with the poorly dated account of the 1845 glacier collapse in Disenchantment Bay and the 1847 Sitka earthquake. However, the tree-ring date for the Lituya Bay seems to fix that event to near the 1853-1854 period but an under-counting is possible. Therefore, these are considered as separate events [1845-1847 and 1853-1854]; the Lituya Bay event does not seem to have been associated with an earthquake. This is the earliest of five landslide tsunamis reported for Lituya Bay by Miller (1960). (Ref #239)\r\n<p>The following is from reference #415:\r\n</p><p>1853/1854. During studies in Lituya Bay, mainly in 1948 and in 1952-1953, clear traces of the past effects of a strong wave were found. Namely, along the northern and in places along the southern shore of the Bay, an age-old forest grew, beginning only at a certain well-marked boundary. Below this boundary and as far as the zone of flood tides, there grew only a young forest. Judging by the number of rings on trunk sections, it was established that the wave arose between the middle of August 1853 and the beginning of May 1854.\r\n</p><p>The maximal known height of this boundary is 120 m (395 feet) above mean sea level; the maximal distance from the water line is 750 m (2500 feet); the known area of the zone of destruction of forest is 3 1/2 km squared. Judging from the remaining traces of erosion, the destructive force of the wave of 1853/1854 was little less than that of the waves of 1958. \r\n</p><p>According to Indian legend, in the 60&#39;s of the XIX century, at the exit from Lituya Bay, eight canoes with people were lost in a sudden flood. The cause of the waves is unknown.</p>",

In this paper we review the potential causes for this landslide based on an integrated study of eye witness testimony, swath bathymetry data and stability analyses. Results show that the Sokkelvik landslide was most likely triggered by intense rainfall and snowmelt, but that the main cause is associated to the load of an up to 7.5 m high embankment fill. This fill was placed at the shoreline for road construction 6 months before the landslide. Results presented herein show the importance of accounting for extreme rainfall events and groundwater flow when planning construction activity in sensitive near shore areas. (reference #11863)</p>",

According to the description, the wave impacted the Levantine coast with effects recorded at Caesarea and Yavne. The tsunami was likely caused by a powerful earthquake that destroyed the city of Antioch (Ambraseys and Jackson, 1998) and originated somewhere along the eastern Cyprean Arc (Ben-Avraham et al., 1995). The construction of Caesarea&#39;s harbor by Herod the Great in 21 B.e. is well documented by excavation work and descriptions of the harbor by the historian Josephus Flavius (Whiston, 1999; Holum et al., 1988). The reasons for the rapid decline in the harbor, about one century later, are less c1ear, and heavily debated (Reinhardt and Raban, 1999; Hohlfelder, 2000). However, the favored interpretation has been the catastrophic destruction of the harbor by an earthquake; although the role of a tsunami has been considered, no conclusive evidence has ever been found (Raban, 1992, 1999; Reinhardt and Raban, 1999; Mart and Perecman, 1996). Records of sub-recent (past 2000 yr) tsunamis in the eastern Mediterranean are based primarily on textual records with variable accuracy (e.g., Neev et al., 1973; Amiran et al., 1994; Mart and Perecman, 1996; Ambraseys and Jackson, 1998; Karcz, 2004), none of which has been substantiated with geological or archaeological evidence.

        "comments": "1751, May (erroneously March) 24 or 25 (after 01:00, local time) there was a destructive earthquake and tsunami in Concepcion. The shock that occurred on the 26th was almost as strong as that of the 25th.<p>The ocean began to recede about half an hour after the quake, and soon the half dressed, frozen and frightened inhabitants of Concepcion climbed the neighbouring hills from where they witnessed the approach of a strong sea wave descending upon the shore. The tsunami flooded the town (then situated in the site of Penco), and washed away the wreckage of buildings and domestic utensils. Seven minutes later the ocean returned with great force &#34;the waves crowded one on another,&#34; and the water level exceeded its usual limits; the water burst into the town with a speed exceeding that of a galloping horse, completely inundating the town. The water advanced quickly along the river, rising and inundating the adjacent areas and flooding even houses on higher ground. Boats and canoes were hurled into the church of San Francisco, located 400-500 m from shore. Subsequently, the water receded, again quite rapidly, carrying with it walls, some of which were still intact, and household items. Where the town had stood there was nothing but an impassable heap of ruins. And in the Cantarranos quarter, only the piles of the houses were left, all the rest having been washed away. Then the water receded again, just as on the previous occasion, but it rose and inundated the area two more times, the third flooding being the most severe. </p><p>The next morning it was established that the water level had varied considerably; in some areas the water had risen more than 3.5 m (4 varas), in others less. <b>Twenty-five to thirty old persons and invalids (17 persons, according to other accounts) were drowned</b> in the waves of the tsunami - the only victims of the earthquake. </p><p>The vessel &#34;St. Anthony and Family,&#34; loaded with goods and passengers, lay at anchor in the port of Concepcion. The seaquake was very severe and it was feared the vessel might be destroyed, but it survived. With the first strong ebb, the anchor chain broke, and the ship itself was grounded, listing heavily. The returning tide hit the vessel, causing it to list the other way. Then the vessel found itself floating. Subsequently, the sea rose 17 m (9 1/2 fathoms) and the ship was thus refloated. There were three strong tides and ebbs, and each time the vessel became grounded. </p><p>After this destructive flood - the fourth and most severe in the history of the city - Concepcion was rebuilt farther  from the shore, and its old location was eventually used to build the new town of Penco. The tsunami was also recorded in Valparaiso. </p><p>The waves hit the island of Juan Fernandez, washed away a settlement and sank a vessel anchored in the port. <b>The governor of the island, his family along with 35 other persons perished</b>. </p><p>The tsunami reached threatening proportions in Callao; but no one died</p><p>There are some reports to the effect that the bottom of Concepcion Bay had risen 7 m (24 feet) during the earthquake; the resulting shoal consisted of hard sandstone rather than sand.</p><p>Naturalists who later visited the area of Concepcion, found, in areas of considerable elevation, many mollusc shells which were packed with river sand; such shells normally occur in the littoral zone.</p><p>The tsunami reached the southeastern coast of the island of Honshu, flooding the houses on Otsuki on the Djika peninsula and in Kesennuma to above the floors, but there were no deaths.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)</p>",

        "comments": "In 1783 Calabria (southern Italy) was shaken by the most violent and persistent seismic crisis occurred in the last two thousands years. Five very strong earthquakes occurred in a short interval of time (February-March), causing destructions and a lot of victims in a vast region embracing the whole southern Calabria and the Messina area, Sicily. Very likely the earthquake is not directly responsible for the tsunami (at the epicentre, waves observed about half an hour later than the ground shaking). Tsunami probably due to a huge earthquake-induced rockfall: a portion of the Monte Campalla (south-western side of the Scilla beach) collapsed into the sea. The front of the failing mass was about 450 m long and penetrated the sea at most by 100 m (Minasi, ref #4125). On the other hand, it was estimated to be more than 2 km long with detachment occurring at a distance ranging from 500 to 2 km onshore and penetreting the sea by a distance of 110 m (De Lorenzo, ref #4132).\r\n<p>At Scilla most of the people, frightened by the sequence of earthquakes, escaped to the open beach and were surprised by the unexpected waves that reached the roof of the buildings. Total number of tsunami <b>victims exceeding 1500</b> (Galimi, ref #4126; Mercalli, ref #4134). Few seconds after the rockfall the sea inundated the district of Marina Grande, reaching the first ffloor of buildings, then it the cliffs of the Castle at Monasina. The water climbed the Livorno stream op to 200 m from the sea shore, then reached Chianalea and Marina dell&#39;Oliveto, located on the other side of the promontory. Three big inundations were observed. At Marina Grande the Santo Spirito church was destroyed, the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, located at a distance of 90m from the shore was inundated as well as San Nicola church. A woman entangled in a mulberry tree at an height of 8.3 m near the Gornelle fountain. According to Sarconi (ref #4124) in Marina Grande (Scilla) inundation heights in the range of 6-9 m observed, while according to Minasi (ref #4125) wave height of 16 m. At Nicotera the sea withdrew then inundated the shore carrying some fishing boats. Also Bagnara affected by the inundation. Cannitello was affected by the waves. At Messina the sea was seen to rise and noisily overflow its coast. According to Minasi (ref #4125) sea level rose of about 2 m. Tsunami also quite relevant at the headlight. At Peloro, near Torre del Faro, flooding of a long stretch of fields, close to the Pantanello small lake. Small houses, people and animals carried seaward. At Torre del Faro coast flooded for about 600 paces. Some boats and 26 victims carried seaward. Run-up height about 6 m. At Punta del Pezzo and surrounding areas sea covering the beach for one and a half mile, leaving some sand on the ground. At Reggio Calabria the sea inundated the shore carrying silk equipment.\r\n</p><p>Revision: Graziani(ref #3954), Tinti (ref #2761)</p>",

Twelve people died in the earthquake and tsunami.</p><p> According to chronicles, some more or less marked changes in the relief of the earth&#39;s surface occurred in the area of the source before the earthquake. In the morning, it was noted that the sea had begun to retreat, and the ground was bulging in places. The residents of Ajigasawa took this as a sign of a tsunami and began to take to less dangerous places. However, the mountains and cliffs collapsed as a result of the shock. In panic, people fled from the landslides and rolling stones to the seaside. At that time, a tsunami wave approached the coast; there were victims. It is possible however, that all this is exaggerated.

The New Madrid earthquakes\r\ngenerated several waves in the rivers. &#34;At first the Mississippi seemed to recede from its banks, its waters gathered up like mountains, leaving boats high upon the sands. The waters then moved inward with a front wall 15 to 20 feet (5 - 7 m) perpendicular and tore boats from their moorings and carried them up a creek closely packed for a quarter of a mile. The river fell as rapidly as it had risen and receded within its banks with such violence that it took with it a grove of cotton wood trees. A great many fish were left upon the banks. The river was literally covered with the wrecks of boats.&#34; (Fuller, 1912)\r\n<p>&#34;A bursting of the earth just below the village of New Madrid, arrested this mighty stream in its course, and\r\ncaused a reflux of its waves, by which in a little time a great number of boats were swept by the ascending current\r\ninto the mouth of the bayou, carried out and left upon the dry earth, when the accumulating waters of the river had\r\nagain cleared their current. On the Mississippi great waves were created, which overwhelmed many boats and washed\r\nothers high upon the shore, the return current breaking off thousands of trees and carrying them out into the river.\r\nHigh banks caved and were precipitated into the river, sand bars and points of islands gave way, and whole islands\r\ndisappeared. (Fuller, 1912)\r\n</p><p>Unusual lake water level rises were seen at Lake Bistineau near Texas-Louisiana border. Lake Caddo, in the\r\nsame area, was probably formed as a result of the earthquake and accompanying subsidence.\r\n(http://www.lakebistineau.com/history/1919article.html, http://www.ops.tamu.edu/x075bb/caddo/caddo.html.)\r\n</p><p>At Orchard Lake, Michigan, it was reported that on December 17, 1911 &#34;the Indians said the waters of the\r\nlake began to boil, bubble, foam and roll about as though they had been in a large kettle over a hot fire, and that in\r\na few minutes up came great numbers of turtles, and hurried to shore, upon which they had a great turtle feast.&#34;\r\n(Hobbs, 1911; Bricker, 1977) Validity 3.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #541)\r\n</p><p>On the river a number were drowned. Bradbury mentions seeing drifting canoes, the owners of which he afterward found had been lost. Hildreth describes the loss of several boats and their crews by caving banks. Lloyd records that a flat boat belonging to Richard Stump was swamped and six men drowned. Many other boats were destroyed by snags and the river was covered with wrecks. So numerous were the disasters that the escape and arrival at Natchez of Capt. Roosevelt with the steamer New Orleans was regarded as almost miraculous. (reference #1854)</p>",

After about three [?] minutes, with a fresh west wind, the water began to flow with terrible swiftness out of the bay [Aleutka] where the settlement was located, and the bottom of the bay was left completely dry. Then with the same speed the bay again filled with water and even inundated the shore to a considerable height. For several days the water was in constant movement; now it would come in, now go down, and each change was accompanied by a strong rip (agitation from the meeting of the currents).&#34;\r\n</p><p>This earthquake, apparently was one of the catastrophic ones, as it was observed on all of the southern Kurile Island and on the east coast of Hokkaido. In the Nemuro and Kushiro areas the earthquake attained destructive force. Thus, it is reported that in the town of Akkeshi, situated between these two points, one of the tombs was moved 1.5 m.; in the temple grounds fissures 10-15 cm. wide were formed. The earthquake was followed by destructive tsunamis; in the Kushiro area the height of the waves was 4.5 m. Especially affected by the tsunamis were the villages located on the shores of Akkeshi Bay which has the shape of a bent funnel, penetrating deeply into the land. In the village of Shinryu, at the bend of the funnel, all of the houses were washed away by the waves and <b>45 persons perished</b>.\r\n</p><p>According to Japanese estimates, the intensity (magnitude) of the earthquake was M &#61; 8.25 to 8.5. Taking into the account the considerable extent of the center of the quake and the area of occurrence of the tsunami, this estimates seems likely to be correct.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #413)\r\n</p><p>April 25, 1845, 42 N, 146 E, magnitude 8.4, tsunami intensity 2, validity 4. <b>46 deaths</b>, 75 houses destroyed.

        "comments": "About 15-20 minutes after the earthquake, at approximately 0215, a wave from the sea poured onto the Denby cannery but caused no damage. Fifteen minutes after the first wave a second wave moved in from the southwest with a height of 11 m. It destroyed the structures on the sandspit and in southwestern part of Ust&#39;-Kamchatsk, passed up the river to the Ozernaia tributary and heaped up fragments of buildings and ice in it. The Kamchatka River was opened about a km and a half above its mouth; a new mouth was formed alongside the former one. <p>The old Denby cannery and the storehouses with goods and products were destroyed and in part washed into the ocean. Eighteen men were killed. The building of the radio-station survived but it was crammed with chunks of ice. The new Denby cannery suffered only in part. Of six cutter belonging to the Denby firm, four were jammed in the ice of the Ozernaia channel and the two others were thrown ashore. </p><p>In the southwest part of Ust&#39;-Kamchatsk six dwellings and several storage sheds, ice-houses, and smokehouses were destroyed, nine houses were half destroyed, animals were killed, many nets, boats, clothes and domestic utensils were completely spoiled. The ebb and flow int he river continued for a considerable time. </p><p>At first there was no information concerning the fate of the Tsutsumi and Nichiro canneries (it was impossible to get to them as the water had poured out over the tundra and the snow was greatly thinned out). At one plant was seen a heap of wreckage, the other was covered with masses of ice. </p><p>On April 23 two Japanese, workers of the Tsutsumi cannery, came to Berezovy Yar. They had had to flee 2.5 km from the wave, which advanced with a great noise. They were saved only thanks to the fact that the wave was held back by the deep snow. Thereafter the Japanese wandered for eight days over the flooded tundra without food or sleep until they stumbled onto the settlement. </p><p>In summer it was found out that both factories were completely destroyed. On the whole, as Troshin and Diagliev indicate, the tsunami extended along the northwest coast of the Gulf of Kamchatka from Cape Shubert to Perevoloka [an extension of the Denby sandpit, it separates Lake Nerpich&#39;e from the Gulf of Kamchatka]. In the area of First Creek the wave had the greatest height. Wreckage from the Nichiro cannery was carried up the valley of that creek. One of the cannery&#39;s cutters was thrown across a low coastal terrace about 1 km. broad and dropped on a slope at a height of about 20 m. In the valley trees were torn up by the roots over a distance of 7-8 km. </p><p>On the banks of Second Creek the destruction was on a smaller scale. Here the wave extended not more than 4.5 km from the mouth. To the northeast of First Creek, inthe area of the Tsutsumi cannery, the wave passed to the north over the tundra only 4km, and Ust&#39;-Kamchats, which is 1 km from the shore of the sea, was affected only on the southwest. Farther east towards Perevoloka the wave was still smaller. The radio station and cannery No. 1 suffered only on the side facing the sea. At Perevoloka the wave was no bigger than a storm wave; drifting timbers and sea week were thrown up on shore 50-70 m. \r\n</p><p>Intense tsunamis spread, apparently, also in a southeast direction from the center of the earthquake. Thus, a wave about 4 m high lashed Bering I. </p><p>(above from reference #413)\r\n</p><p>April 13, 1923, 1530 GMT. A magnitude 7.2 earthquake off the east coast of Kamchatka, Russia, generated a 20-m tsunami that caused some damage there and in Korea.

An eyewitness described the wave as moving northward from a point within the middle of the north Dead Sea basin.

The associated tsunami was the most destructive of all those produced in the Mesoamerican Trench in this century, and destroyed the resort of Cuyutlan, Col. A 10 m wave caused the death of more than 75 people and more than 100 were injured. The extension of the horizontal inland flood was 1 km, and the water reached the railroad tracks. Material damages were estimated at beween 2 and 6 million pesos (3.65 pesos to the dollar). Hotels and private houses by the beach were totally destroyed. The main street lost all its cobblestones, and some people were buried in the sand. The sea avalanche rushed over the houses, invading the main street. The population ran for cover, but some persons were caught by the waves and disappeared in them, screaming in terror. Not a single house was left standing in a stretch 20 km long and 1 km wide. <p>A section of the railroad track between Cuyutlan and Manzanillo was obstructed by sand, trees and bushes dragged by the tsunami. This phenomenon hit a 25 km extension from Ventanas (Manzanillo), to Salinas de Guasango (Tecoman). In Tenancingo, the tsunami also caused some casualties. Cuyutlan was invaded by two tsunami waves of less intensity: one during the night of June 22nd, and the other shortly after nine o&#39;clock in the morning of the 23rd. That time, the water only reached the main square in the resort, approximately 500 m from the coast.

Andaman earthquake had a moment magnitude Mw 7.7 and was located at 12.1 N and 92.5 E (Bilham et al., 2005). A tsunami was triggered by this earthquake in the Bay of Bengal. Height of the tsunami was reported to be of the order of 0.75 to 1.25 meters. At the time no tidal gauge was in operation. Mathematical calculations suggest that the height could be of the order of l m. This tsunami was witnessed along the eastern coast of India. It is believed that nearly 5,000 people were killed by the tsunami on the east coast of India. Local newspapers are believed to have mistaken the deaths and damage to a storm surge, however, a search of meteorological records does not show any storm surge on that day on the Coromandel Coast (Murty, 1984). National dailies like the Times of India, which reported the quake&#39;s shaking effects, did not mention any deaths, either as a result of a storm surge or a tsunami. (reference #2771)</p><p>The most recent of the major earthquakes in the Andaman Islands preceding the 2004 rupture occurred in 1941, a year before Japanese occupation of the islands. The earthquake was described only after the Second World War Ghingran, 1953; Krishnan, 1953). Although the tsunami generated by the 1941 earthquake is stated to have caused much loss of life along the east coast of India (Murty and Rafiq, 1991), no official (or unofficial) account of the impact of the remote tsunami has been discovered. Jhingran describes the loss of low-lying western-facing forest cover on the Andamans, presumably by a tsunami, but mentions no loss of life. Eyewitness reports published informally by the Society of Andaman and Nicobar Ecology (SANE) following the 2004 earthquake add further details to the official 1941 accounts. The central watchtower of the cellular jail in Port Blair collapsed along with a hospital and other masonry structures. Eyewitnesses spoke of subsidence of Ross Island (as in the recent earthquake), requiring its abandonment in favor of the current mainland capital, Port Blair. (reference #8835)</p><p>The small tsunami results from a combination of that mechanism and of a source located under the islands themselves and in shallow water, implying a reduction in amplitude under Green&#39;s law when transitioning to a deeper basin[...]Murty and Rafiq (1991) suggested that it resulted in 5000 deaths in India. However, Ortiz and Bilham (2003) and Bilham et al. (2005) have failed to unravel any scientific or press evidence to support this assertion (in contrast, e.g., to the Car Nicobar event of 1881), casting strong doubt on its veracity: it is extremely unlikely that a 1-m tsunami would result in such a death toll. (reference #12507)</p><p>Finally, the 1941 earthquake in the Andaman often appears in lists of IOT, but we could find no direct observation of a tsunami associated with this event (e.g. Jhingran 1952, only reports \u2018\u2018there is no doubt that extensive waves\u2019\u2019 impacted the Andamans). Murty and Rafiq (1991) claim this event killed 5000 people along the west coast of India, but neither our archive search nor that of Ortiz and Bilham (2003) were able to confirm this claim. (reference #2725)</p><p>An earthquake of magnitude 8.1 occurred in the Andaman Sea at 12.9 N and 92.5 E on 26th June 1941 and a tsunami hit the east coast ofIndia.

        "comments": "543, 40.3 N, 28 E, earthquake intensity 10.5. Many sources report a strong earthquake affecting the town of Cyzicus (Asia Minor), destroying the city. The date of occurrence is uncertain: some authors date the event in 542 B.C., others in 543 B.C. or in 544/545. According to Giudoboni, the description of anomalous sea behavior in Thrace is dated 544/545 B.C. In area of Odessos (today Varna), Dionisopolis (today Balchik) and Afrodision the sea went out of its coasts as far as 4000 steps (about 5.8 km) in the Thrace coast. Many people drowned. (ref. #4139) <p>542 (possibly 543, Sept. 6), winter. Region of the Sea of Marmara. An earthquake. Cyzicus was destroyed. In some places, the shore of Thrace was flooded for 3-4 km including Odessus, (i&#61;4). The sea returned to its normal state after many people were killed and much damage done. Waves were observed in Dionysioupolis, Aphrodesion, in the Gulf of Edremit, in Asia Minor where many towns were flooded. There exists no reliable information on the preceding earthquake, but values of its parameters are available: 40.3 N, 27.8 E, M &#61; 6.8. (ref #2130) </p><p>542 Winter. Sea of Marmara. Thracian Coasts and Gulf of Edremit. From Cedrinos we learn that in the reign of Justinianus the sea flooded the coasts of Thrace and that the cities of Odessa (Varna), Dionysioupolis, Aphrodesion and other towns in the gulf of Adramyttium were inundated. The sea in many places advanced four miles inland and after drowning many people and causing heavy damage to the land retired to its habitual places... Neither Cedrinos nor Glycas imply in any way that the inundation of the Thracian coasts was the result of an earthquake. We notice, however, that Theophanes and Cedrinos mention in this period an earthquake which devastated Kyzicos (Banderma) and damaged Constantinople. This earthquake can be easily placed in the beginning of Sept 542 AD. This inundation of Thracian and Aegean coasts shows quite clearly the characteristics of a seismic sea-wave. It does not seem improbable that the cause of this wave was in fact the earthquake at Kyzicos (Banderma). When these two events happen to be so closely spaced together. From the narrations of the writers in the Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae on earthquake events of the period, one feels inclined to go even further and suggest the earthquake at Constantinople of 542, that of Kyzikos and the seismic sea-wave that followed belong, if not to the same earthquake, but to the activation of the Marmara region. (ref #24) </p><p>544. Black Sea. A destructive sea wave in the Black Sea flooded the coast of Thrace, inundating Odessus (now Varna), Dionysopolis (now Balchik) and Aphrodisium by advancing 4 miles inland, drowning many people before retiring. This event is mentioned by Theophanes, who places it in a.M. 6037 (Sept 544 to Aug 545), or in the 18th year of Justinian (Cedr. CS 657), which commenced in April 544. He does not mention, however, whether this event was associated with an earthquake. (ref #9116) </p><p> Tsunami observed in the Kapidag Peninsula, Erdek, Bandirma. (ref #11164) </p><p> </p><blockquote><i>Ref #11868:</i></blockquote>  <p>A large earthquake occurring offshore of the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea, very likely produced a strong tsunami that inundated in three coastal zones, namely Odessus, today Varna; Dionysopolis, today Balchik; Aphrodisium, situated in the Thracian Peninsula at the Xeros (today Saros) Bay, Northeast Aegean Sea. It is reported that sea advanced on Thrace by 4 mi and covered the three territories. Many drowned in the waters. However, no further details available. It is puzzling how a single tsunami event was capable to inundate coastal zones in Bulgarian Black Sea and the same time Thracian coasts facing the North Aegean Sea. This tsunami event is a good example, which indicates several uncertainties that often arise from historical documentation of tsunamis.</p>",

About the same time an earthquake shock was felt in Smyrna. The details of the effects of this earthquake on land and at sea are given in three separate reports made by captains arriving in Zante, which confirm that the shock was associated with a seismic sea wave.

        "comments": "On March 6, 1895, at 6:35 p.m. [local time] when anchored in the Trobriand Group off the small island of Yaga; latitude 8<sup>o</sup> 32.5&#39;S, longitude 151<sup>o</sup> 02.5&#39;E, the shock of an earthquake was felt. The ship heaved and trembled for over a minute. The motion was slight but marked, and was very like the motion imparted to the ship by the action of the screw when it is reversed and the fore part of the ship is aground. So far as I saw, the shock did not affect the surface of the sea near the vessel. <p>On our arrival at Kavatari next morning we found that the earthquake had been felt on shore at that place. It had caused the trees to sway and a cavity had been formed near the village. The cavity, a few yards in diameter and about four feet deep at its deepest part, had apparently been due to the giving way of the covering of an underground hollow.\r\n</p><p>On the following day we reached the island of Sim-Sim and learned that earthquake shocks had been felt in the evening of March 6th, and that the island had also suffered from a wave of the sea. The account given us by a native of the earthquake and the wave was this: A little after sunset they experienced a shock, then followed a loud booming sound apparently not very far off, then another shock. After this there was a lull for a short time, and then they heard the noise of the advancing wave, which almost immediately afterwards swept over the flat. The waters knocked the frail native houses down and swept portions of them, together with household goods, into the sea. <b>One little child was drowned</b>, and one man we saw that received some severe abrasions of the skin. \r\n</p><p>A native of Buna village, says that &#39;about 11 years ago (1895) the water came up in the same way but very much higher, and he gave me the <b>names of 26 people of Buna who lost their lives</b>. A report states &#39;My information indicates that it was a true earthquake-induced tidal wave or tsunami - the sea receded some distance before the wave came in. The wave traveled inland some 4 miles south to about the area of Ononda. I interviewed MacKenzie on 14.9.71. He was not able to tell me a lot except that his father was a small boy at the time, and that the <b>wave was probably about 20 ft high</b> and it had left Nixon in some thorn bushes.&#39; </p><p>When we reached Cape Vogel on March 21, we learned from the natives there that a short time back a great wave had struck the shore, apparently in Porlock Bay. News of the catastrophe had come down the coast to Cape Vogel. The natives could not give the date, but the time they gave was a little after dark, which corresponds with the time the water swept on Sim-Sim. The natives said that <b>four small villages in Porlock Bay which are close to each other were washed away and some people drowned</b>. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #99)\r\n</p><p>Reports indicate that the tsunami was very localised and/or directional, the water receded first then returned as a 6m high tsunami at Sim-Sim yet no impact was observed on Kawa only 20km away. A \u0091great wave&#39; was reported in Porlock Bay on the Papuan Peninsula west of the Trobriand\r\nIslands where four villages were washed away, some of the villagers drowned. At Buna it is reported that 26 people drowned (Everingham, 1977). We have assumed the tsunami height there was 3 to 5m to cause the damage reported. At Simbang (near Finschhafen) the detailed sea-level observations made by missionary J. G. Pfalzer describe a typical tsunami with run-up of about 1m. (reference #11522)</p>",

        "comments": "A huge glacier has broken off and plunged into a lake in Peru sparking a 23-meter high tsunami wave that destroyed a nearby town. The massive chunk of ice --called Hualcan glacier, it was around the size of four soccer fields -- tumbled into the &#39;513 lake&#39; in the Andes near Carhuaz, around 200 miles north of Lima. According to the Indeci civil defense institute, 50 homes have been destroyed. A water processing plant serving 60,000 local residents was also devastated when the wave struck on Sunday. Initially, six people were reported missing, feared dead under the debris -- but local governor Cesar Alvarez has said five of those have been found alive. Authorities evacuated mountain valleys, fearing more ice breakage after the tsunami, which are most commonly caused by earthquakes. Investigators have said the ice block from the Hualcan glacier measured 1,600 feet  by 650 feet. Patricio Vaderrama, a Peruvian glacier expert, said: &#34;The tsunami wave breached the lake&#39;s levees, which are 23m high -- meaning the wave was 23m high,&#34; or 75 feet. (reference #7015)",

In fact, everything within its course was destroyed: including twelve houses and some twenty-five outbuildings, which were entirely destroyed to their very foundations; while on the margin of the ice movement several other buildings were more or less damaged. On the west bank where the slide started, three houses were entirely destroyed, together with several outbuildings. The total loss of life as far as can be ascertained, was thirty-three persons. The rush of ice was followed by a rush of water from the river, which carried portions of the ruined buildings and the bodies of villagers inland beyond the road which is parallel to the shore; depositing the debris at an elevation of about fifty feet above the river level.

It goes on to say that, at Echinus and at Scarphea in Boeotia in the Gulf between Thessaly and Boetia, there was a sudden inlux of the sea, which leveled both towns. The sea flooded the mainland for a long time, so that for a very considerable period it was possible for men to walk to the islands, which are inside this gulf, since the sea had abandoned its proper place and spread over the land as far as the mountains. When the sea returned to its proper place, fish were left on the ground.</p><p>It is important to recognize that Procopius places earthquakes in the plural, in the context of more than one earthquake in more than one place... he clearly refers to more than one, probably three, distinct earthquakes in central Greece, that is (1) a destructive shock in Boeotia that caused great loss of life in Schisma and destroyed Coronea and Chaeronea, probably damaging Corinth; (2) <strong>a destructive sea wave at Echinus and Scarpheia</strong>, which was probably associated with a second earthquake about 70 km away in the Maliakos Gulf between Thessaly and Boettia; and (3) a damaging shock more than 100 km to the west of Schisma in the Gulf of Corinth and in Achaea, which heavily damaged Nafpaktos and Patra.

Excerpt from journal of the ship&#39;s commander: On Jan 8, 1780, on the 18th island, called Urup, there were great quakings of the earth, every day, both by day and by night. ... On June 18 [June 18 Julian date is equal to June 29 in Gregorian calendar], in the night before morning, almost at dawn, there was a great and terrible quaking of the earth, which continued for a quarter of an hour \u0085 they looked at the sea: in the distance fires flashed like lightning.  And a little while after the quake there was suddenly a loud rumbling. That was the running out to sea of a strange, swift tide. Stones which had been in the sea by the shore were left dry. And with the same noise first the water ran in from the sea in a great wave, and the whole shore, except for the bluff, was covered, and then the water, swiftly and with the same noise, returned to the sea. And the sea fell even more than before... And the water came swiftly from the sea like a wall, rising higher than all of the small shore crags by 5 or 6 sazhens, and it suddenly poured into the cove with as strong and sharp an onslaught as on the bluffs of the river. Our yurts and huts and everything that was there, to the last post, were torn from the ground and carried away up the creek into the gulch. And all of the people and their gear were carried along the gulch. Even stones which had been at the mouth of the creek were rolled out and carried away. There was an iron cannon on the bluff -- it was found about 50 sazhens away. And the gulches near the sea were filled with water to the top. The ship, the brigantine Sviataia Natalica, was carried with its anchor straight along the creek over the tundra into the gulch and was set down on dry ground near a rivulet. From the sea to the ship was 190 sazhens. And the breadth of the low ground across the gulch at the place where the ship was would be about 100 sazhen. Of the working people, they found <b>4 dead after the water went down</b>. And all that day until evening the water went back and forth, rising and falling, only less from hour to hour. And afterwards the people gathered all of the baggage that had been carried away and dried it. And after several days they went in skin boats to visit their people who had been elsewhere. They learned that the eastern and southern sides of the island had been inundated by the flood. At one place <b>eight of the natives were drowned</b>, they said. On the north side of the island there was no flood and the water did not rise at all. It is not known whether there was a rising of the water beyond where we were, on the 19th (Iturup) and 20th (Kumashir) islands. On June 28 Shabalin lent people to Kamchatka in one skin boat with the report, and I had to follow them on July 1 through the islands from the 18th. From the time of the flood up until our departure there were frequent quakes every day. On the 17th (Chirpoi), 16th (Simushir), and 15th (Ketoi) islands, also, there were frequent tremors while we were there. The sea flood which had risen on the 18th island had also come up on these islands but less. On the 14th (Ushishir) and other islands closer to Kamchatka there were no longer frequent quakes and there had been no rising of the waters.<p>Erroneously reported on the following date(s)in other publications: June 18, January 19.</p><p></p><blockquote>Reference #150</blockquote>1780, June 29. 45.3 N, 151.2 E, tsunami validity 4, magnitude 3.

At approximately 7 p.m., on 16 June 1819, Fort Sindri and masonry buildings in villages within a radius of 80 km were destroyed by a violent earthquake. A tsunami from the Arabian Sea surged across the Rann and sand vents in the region were active to a height of 2-3 m for three days, venting water and gas (Bombay Public Consultations, 1819; MacMurdo, 1835)... The fort at Anjar was destroyed, and a similar fate befell the fort at Sindri in the Rann of Kachchh. Sketches of Sindri fort before and after the earthquake collected by Lye11 (1853) are reproduced in Johnson and Kanter (1992), and a view of the decaying ruins in 1869 is reproduced in Wynne (1872). According to testimony elicited by Burnes (1833, 1835) a tsunami flooded the Rann of Kachchh within minutes of the earthquake and survivors were forced to climb to the top of the ruin where they were rescued the following morning by boat. Ballantyne writing from Jooria on the northern shore of Kachchh in June 17 relates (MacMurdo, 1835) that &#34;the whole town is a complete ruin&#34; and on June 18th describes ground fissures symptomatic of catastrophic-lateral-spreading; &#34;on examining the different rents, we found them to be of various extent from an inch to a foot in breadth; the depth however, being considerable, being 10, 15 and 20 feet.

The little brick fort of Sindri, 150 ft. square, was, he says &#34; overwhelmed at once with a tremendous inundation of water from the ocean, which spread on all sides, and in a few hours completely flooded the country, and converted the tract, which had before been hard and dry, into an inland lake, extending for sisteen miles on each side of Sindri... Of the four towers but one now remains; the inhabitants saved themselves from destruction by ascending it, and only reached the land on the following day by boats&#34;. &#34;It was soon discovered &#34;, he adds, &#34;that this was not the only alteration effected...; as the inhabitants of Sindri observed at a distance of five miles northward, a mound of earth or sand in a place where previously the soil was low and level. It extended nearly east and west about sixteen miles... The natives called this &#39;Allahband&#39; or the band of God, in allusion to its not being, like the other dams in the Indus, the work of man.&#34; (reference #516)</p>",

At Haiti, the destructive tsunami struck the northern coast. At Mole Saint-Nicolas [<i>probably damage only from the earthquake</i>], and Cap-Haitien, extensive destruction was caused by the earthquake and tsunami. At Port-de-Paix, the sea receded 60 m, and the returning wave covered the city with 5 m of water killing 200-300 of the city&#39;s 3,000. At Santo Domingo, 2 m waves were observed. The tsunami was observed at Forte-Liberte and Santiago de los Caballeros [<i>unlikely since it is located 40-5 km from the coast</i>]. At St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, the height was 3.1 m. Waves of 2 m caused destruction on the north coast of Hispaniola.

Destruction was greatest at Cap Haitien, a city of 10,000 inhabitants, which lost half of its population. The intensity was almost equally as high at Mole St. Nicolas, Port de Paix, Fort Liberte and Santiago de los Caballeros, all of which were destroyed with the loss of several thousands of lives. At Cap Haitien waves dashed against buildings along the quay; at Port de Paix the sea withdrew 60 m. and, upon returning, buried the city under 4 or 5 m. of water. The bed of the Yaqui River is\r\nsaid to have been suddenly elevated, driving its waters both up and down stream. The shock was severe at Santiago de Cuba and was felt throughout the length of the Sierra Maestra.

        "comments": "<p>Several phenomena occurred during this event, including a double tectonic tsunami generated by violent back-to-back earthquakes [Ms&#61;7.5] that originated 15 to 20 kilometers southwest of St. Thomas, along the north scarp of the Anegada Trough. Characterized by initial vertical oscillations, probably due to a massive down-drop of the fault blocks, the two tremendous shocks separated by an interval of 10 to 15 minutes launched immense tsunamis that propagated in all directions, the second larger than the first. The leading trough caused the ocean to recede from shores on all sides of the seismic convulsion. Produced as well, were the landslide tsunami at Guadeloupe and possible volcanic activity at St. Thomas and at Grenada. The most momentous tsunami known to have affected the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Danish West Indies at the time, it was also significant because of its impact on much of the rest of the Caribbean. Waves were reported from Jamaica to Grenada.\r\n</p><p>The 3 ships-of-war, the Susquehanna, De Soto, and Monongahela, comprised a squadron of naval vessels that brought U.S. officials to the Danish West Indies to consummate the purchase of the islands from Denmark.  The negotiations failed, due not only to the 5 deaths and damage to 2 of the 3 warships sent there, but also to growing doubt about the advisability of purchasing islands prone to such havoc as the devastations by the hurricane, the earthquake, the tsunami, and the yellow fever epidemic that followed. (A cholera epidemic rampaged the island exactly one year before.) Yellow fever carried off Rear Admiral Palmer, Commander of the U.S. fleet, 3 weeks later.</p><p>&#34;Brete Harte added his parody about the situation as a poem about the &#39;demise&#39; of St. Thomas entitled: &#39;Saint Thomas, A Geographical Survey,&#39; beginning:</p><br /><i>Very fair and full of promise<br />Lay the island of St. Thomas<br />...<br />So the Mountains shook and thundered,<br />And the Hurricane came sweeping,<br />And the people stared and wondered,<br />As the Sea came on them leaping:<br />Each, according to its promise,<br />Made things lively at St. Thomas.<br />Till one morn, when Mr. Seward<br />Cast his weather eye to leeward,<br />There was not an inch of dry land<br />Left to mark his recent island.<br />Not a flagstaff or a sentry,<br />Not a wharf or port of entry,-<br />Only-to cut matters shorter-<br />Just a patch of muddy water<br />In the open ocean lying,<br />And a gull above it flying.</i><br /><p>(above from Reference #1492)\r\n</p><p>Reid and Taber report: &#34;A great sea wave was started by the first shock, and a second larger one by the second shock some ten minutes laters; other waves followed but were relatively unimportant.

Ionian Sea, Gulf of Corinth. 38.5 N, 22.5 E, earthquake intensity X, magnitude 7, tsunami intensity 4, validity 2. A strong earthquake occurred in Central Greece, preceded by shocks that started in the middle of July. It embraced the isthmus of Corinth and the shore of the Gulf of Corinth. Two vertical and several wavy horizontal movements followed the thunderous boom which lasted several tens of seconds. These movements were not sharp shocks, but a slow rising and subsiding. The earth rose upwards like a carpet blown by a storm. Shocks of extreme force seemed to follow the line from Galaxidi on the shore of the Gulf of Corinth toward Amfssa, Antikyma, Arahova, Delfi, Distomo, Doubia, Chrysos. Almost all the houses tumbled down in most of these settlements, as well as in the villages of Itea, Cassotis, Kastris, Pirnaki and others. Thus, port Itea was destroyed completely; not one house stood fast in Chrysos near the foot of Mt Pamassus, and 11 people were killed; there was serious destruction in Delfi; the badly constructed houses in Thermopyles crumbled down already at the first shock, and so on. The ground cracked in the vicinity of Thermopyles, and vapour came out of fissures up to 1.5 - 2 m in width. The shocks were strong in Athens, Lamia, Piraeus, Chalkida, not so strong in Corinth, Patras, Aiyion. The oscillations of the ground lasted for several hours; the earthquake was accompanied by numerous aftershocks, at least 400, lasting till August 17. Strong shocks were noted at 8h15m a.m. and at 13h40m, the sea advanced deep onto the dry land in Chalkida for 2 m on August 1 or 5 [Perrey, 1875a,b; Fuchs, 1886; Levinson - Lessing,1924].

It was apparently incomparably stronger than all other earthquakes in the memory of the European settlers. A tidal wave appeared (in Tuilagi) about 10 minutes after the earthquake on the 4th. At Kira Kira, the rise of water was about 2 m, but since it was ebb tide, the water rose only to the high tide mark, without doing any <b>damage except to one recently built stone moorage</b>, which had already been partly destroyed by the earthquake. \r\n</p><p>This wave was observed along the entire northern coast of San Cristobal, being somewhat larger in the eastern part of the shore and gradually diminishing to nothing in the direction to the western tip of the island. \r\n</p><p>At Port Mary (Santa Ana Island), the water retreated a very large distance, and then, after a brief pause, rose quickly and reached the highest high tide mark. This cycle of movements, which required about a minute for its completion, recurred three times with diminishing amplitude. According to depth measurements made after the sea had calmed down, the lowest level reached by the water was about 3.5 m below the lowest low tide mark, so that the total rise and fall of water was about 5.5 m.\r\n</p><p>Judging by available data, on the south cast of San Cristobal Island, between Cape Surville and Cape Sydney, the water first retreated from shore some distance beyond the lowest low tide mark (it was ebb tide) and then returned and rose, and the water surface became like a wall, which arose at the edge of the reefs. This wall advanced on land like a monolith, carrying away everything in its path. The cycle recurred three times.\r\n</p><p>The highest level reached was clearly marked on the trees which withstood the onslaught of the water and at most places was about 6 m above the high high tide mark, although at the center of the affected area, whether because the disturbance of the surface of the water nearby was greater, or because of the shore configuration, the level reached was at least 9 m above the high water mark.\r\n</p><p><b>Tsunami waves destroyed 18 villages on San Cristobal island; 50 people died</b> (according to other sources 26 people).\r\n</p><p>Gutenberg, Richter (1954): 3.X; 19h13m13S; 10.5 S,\r\n161.75 E.; M&#61;7.9.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #132:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1931, October 3.

The emergent nature of the two readings, the early arrival times and the long duration of waves of 36 hours at Long Beach and at Santa Monica indicate a meteorological source with perhaps some seiches set up by the earthquake.

The earthquake was also characterized by the eruption of a mud volcano, a few km off the Makran coast, which are common features in western Pakistan. It led to the formation of four small islands. A large volume of gas that erupted from one of the islands, sent flames leaping &#34;hundreds of meters&#34; into the sky (Mathur, 1998).

At Pasni a small wave arrived soon after the mainshock, but according to Pendse (1948, ref#10984), who does not cite his source, the damaging tsunami did not arrive until 3.25 hours later. Pendse (1948) also describes the damaging 1.5-m wave at Karachi as having followed three earlier, smaller waves during the previous two hours. Ambraseys and Melville (1982, ref #1117) indicate that two damaging waves arrived at Pasni 90 and 120 minutes after the mainshock. Although accounts conflict to some extent, it appears that the largest tsunami wave did not arrive at Pasni until several hours following the mainshock.

A most remarkable aspect of the 1945 tsunami is that its main waves were significantly delayed (avg 2.5 h) with respect to the earthquake. (ref #11443)</p><p>Total number of casualties along the entire area of impact is estimated in the order of a couple of hundreds. <strong>Reports of several thousand casualties are exaggerated</strong> and derive from early estimations that were not confirmed.

        "comments": "At least 8 separate tsunamis, generated by submarine and subaerial landslides and ice falls, followed this magnitude 7.9 earthquake.  The epicenter was located on the northern coast of Cross Sound near Palma Bay.  Underwater cables were broken in Juneau, Skagway, and Wrangell.  A local submarine slump off Khantaak Island in Yakutat Bay caused <b>3 deaths</b> and wrecked a boat.  Lituya Bay, the site of repeated huge local tsunamis, experienced a massive landslide which generated a surge of water reaching 525 meters in height -- 400 feet higher than the Empire State Building.  2 boats were wrecked, and <b>2 deaths</b> resulted.  30 million cubic meters of soil and loose material were washed away, along with ten square km of forest.  Shellfish colonies, a cabin, and mining equipment were also destroyed by this massive surge.  Total property damage --primarily from the three lost boats -- exceeded $100,000 (Reference #239).\r\n<p>The earthquake caused numerous rock avalanches and slides. In Disenchantment Bay, a &#34;chunk&#34; weighing several tons broke off from a glacier descending to the water; waves 6 m high arose on the surface of the bay. On Khantaak Island, the sea waves resulting from a coastal section submerging under water reached a height of 5-6 m. A collapse in the mouth of the Alsek River caused a wave 1-2 m high, which spread upriver. The water level in the lower reaches dropped approximately 1 m; several hours later, the dam was breached and the shores of the river were flooded. In Glacier Bay, rocks crashed down from the steep beaches, resulting in small waves no more than 1/2-1 m (2-3 feet) high. Similar waves were observed in Dixon Harbor several minutes after the earthquake. The most catastrophic events, unique in the history of strong earthquakes, occurred in Lituya Bay, which is the T-shaped bed of an ancient glacier that has been filled in with water. The distinctive feature of the bay is the strong tidal currents at the throat, reaching 12 knots in velocity. At the time of the earthquake, about 300 million square meters of rock collapsed into Gilbert Bay from the northeast shore. The water extruded from the bay by the collapsing mass, splashed up on the opposite shore, reaching a colossal height. The movement of the water was so fast, that it uprooted a whole forest in the flood zone and stripped the bark and branches from the trees. Besides this gigantic splash, the collapse of this huge mass gave rise to a wave, which crossed the entire Lituya Bay from Gilbert Bay to the sea with a velocity of 150-200 km/hr, that is, with the speed of gravity waves, and devastated the shores of Lituya Bay. The tectonic dislocations in the source of the earthquake, and possibly the wave emerging from Lituya Bay, gave rise to a small tsunami, which was registered on remote tide gauges (Reference #415).\r\n</p><p>The main mass of the slide, as outlined on figure 16, is a prism of rock that is roughly triangular in cross section, with dimensions of 2,400 feet and 3,000 foot along tho slope, a maximum thickness of about 300 feet normal to the slope, and a center of gravity at about 2,000 foot altitude. From those dimensions and an assumed specific gravity of 2.7, the volume and weight of tho rock mass are, respectively, <b>40 million cubic yards and 90 million tons</b>. It is highly probable that this entire mass plunged into Gilbert Inlet as a unit at the time of the earthquake, although tho only known fact is that it fell between about noon on July 7 and about 10 .m on July 10.

A magnitude Ms 7.1 earthquake occurred near the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea 850 km northwest of Port Moresby, the capitol of Papua New Guinea (PNG). The earthquake, which occurred at 6:49 P.M. local time, was followed by a series of three catastrophic tsunami waves that devastated the villages of Sissano, Warupu, Arop (1 &amp; 2) and Malol on the north coast of PNG killing at least 2,182, injuring 1,000, and displacing more than 10,000.<p>The earthquake was felt widely in PNG coastal communities. In the Aitape region, it was reportedly strong enough to make walking difficult and to knock objects over. The main shock was followed 20 min later by two moderate aftershocks that occurred so close together that they appeared to be a single event.</p><p>The three waves affected a 40-km length of coastline from the mouth of the Bliri River on the west to the town of Aitape on the east. This length of coastline was home to around 15,000 people before the tsunami. The area is predominantly tropical swamp land-a home to tribes that rely on subsistence farming and fishing and live in beach homes made of local materials. This section of coastline was particularly vulnerable because a narrow strip of land separates the ocean from Sissano Lagoon, a lagoon formed by a tsunami in 1907.</p><p>At many locations along this stretch of coastline the first wave arrived about 20 min. after the main shock (just after the first aftershocks). The trough of the first wave arrived soon after dark accompanied by loud sounds that drew curious tribesmen to the beach where they viewed the exposed sea floor. This was followed by an air blast that reportedly knocked people off their feet and a 7 to 10-meter tsunami crest. At Warupu and the Arop villages the second crest was described as riding on the back of the first and breaking over the villages, sweeping debris over the spit and washing it into the lagoon or 500 m inland from the coast. Trees were uprooted, and mature mangroves were broken off at distances of 1,300 m from the shore. Maximum wave heights reached nearly 15 m along a 20-km stretch of the lagoon area.</p><p>The villages of Arop and Warupu were entirely destroyed.<i><blockquote>Ref #11882</blockquote></i>In 1998, the official estimate of deaths resulting from the tsunami was just over 2,200. Working back from the names listed on the memorials that were erected a year later, on 17 July 1999, authorities have been able to <b>confirm 1,636 deaths</b> (written communication from Tom Ritchie). The difference between the two figures remains unexplained. A further 1,000 were treated for serious wounds (p.48).\r\n<i><blockquote>Ref #2707</blockquote></i>The death toll of the Aitape tsunami disaster has been confirmed at 2,182 as of 7 August 1998 while over 500 people are still missing. Major human damage are reported from three villages on sandbar of Sissano lagoon. Almost damage caused by the tsunami. Number of dead and missing is over 2,000. The population before the disaster was about 6,600 and the casualty reached a third of the population. Especially, over two thirds of the people were dead in Arop and Wrapu. The damage of this tsunami concentrated there. These two villages locate on a sand spit of Sissano Lagoon. Sissano Lagoon is 10 km in length, 3 km in width and 2 to 3 m in depth. It was made by the 1907 earthquake. Because the sand spit is 100 to 200 m in width and 2.5 to 3 m in height houses on this sand spit could be washed out easily by the tsunami. Its building was destroyed and only its foundation remained. The average maximum heights of the tsunami waves they crossed the Sissano sandbar was about 10 m. However, the wave height varies at different points long the sandbar and was as high as 15 m above the sea level at the former site of the Arop village. In this 1.2km long sector of the sandbar nothing was left standing now. There was a complete stripping of structures and trees.</p>",

This event is also dated July 11, which is the Julian date, and as July 22, the Gregorian date uncorrected for the now-existing\r\nInternational Date Line. This great earthquake, which ruptured at least a 600 kilometer segment of the plate boundary (extending from Kodiak Island perhaps to Unga Island or beyond), produced strong ground motion and landslides at both Kodiak and Unga Islands. Extensive loss was reported on Kodiak Island due to multiple tsunami produced by this event. Subsidence was also reported at Kodiak near the harbor. Aftershocks on Kodiak Island lasted a month or longer. Clearly there was an earthquake and tsunami at Three Saints Harbor on July 11 (Julian date).

The coast of the island may have subsided somewhat. &#34;Before we had come to our &#34;senses after the tremor, a flood came in from the sea.&#34;  In Three Prelates Harbor at Kodiak Island, several buildings were washed away, and the soil was partially washed out and littered; two large waves were observed. On Unga Island, the water rose 115 m (50 fathoms) [?], and many Aleutians died. &#34;The water passed over Sanak Island in strong, uncommon roller; &#34;some swine brought to the island drowned. The tsunami was also observed at Pavlov village, but with considerably less force. There were no noticeable waves on the northern side of Unimak Island.

Western coast from Cape Lopatka to Ust&#39; Kamchatsk settlement, Commander Islands. </p><p>1737. The tsunami of this year [1737], according to some data, can be considered the strongest of all those known on Kamchatka and the Kurile Islands. Detailed accounts of the phenomenon are listed below. </p><p>Through persons who have come from the Kuril, from the islands and from Cape Lopatka, also from Avacha, I have learned that there was a great earth tremor there, which began at all of the places mentioned at the same time. </p><p>On the first of the Kurile Islands, called Sumshchu [Shumehu], the earthquake was of the following form. On October 17 [October 6 Julian calendar] at 3 o&#39;clock in the night the earth shook so sharply at first that many huts fell down. This quake came in waves from the SSE, and as soon as the shaking ceased suddenly came from the sea with great noise about 3 sazhens [6 m] of water, which immediately went out again far to sea. </p><p>With the recession of the water the earth shook again, only very slightly, and afterwards the water again came from the sea to the same place where it had been the first time. After a quarter of an hour the waters of the sea for the third time, with a very great noise, came up to about 10 sazhens higher than the previous places, which carried away many native dwellings. This water ran off again into the sea and throughout two days rose and fell. </p><p>Around Lopatka and at Avacha the quake began at the same date and hour, only it was slight the first time, but the second and third times it was as on the island, very sharp, so that many huts fell down. After the third time, the water came from the sea with a great noise, about 15 sazhens high, covering - all of the low places round about and also the lower hills. It carried away many native dwellings, baggage, food, and skin boats and caused no little loss to the Russians who were there at the time, who, leaving all of their baggage in the yurts, had to flee to high ground and there seek to save themselves. Between the rivers Viliuchik and the Avacha cove a small new cove was made. The place where the cove was formed was a meadow with kliukva and shiksha berries and two huts stood there in which the natives had put food. At the time of the great water the huts were carried away with the ground and two native women and a man who were in the huts were drowned. </p><p>An excerpt from a journal provide grounds for supposing that in 1737 strong tsunamis also lashed the Komandorsky Islands: </p><p>The greatest changes on the island [Bering] may have resulted from earthquakes and high sea tides. Indubitable signs of powerful inundations were driftwood, bones of whales, and whole skeletons of sea cows which had been carried high up on the shores or far into ravines toward the center of the island. By the age of the drift logs I could conclude quite confidently that in the inundation of 1738 [an obvious error; 1737 is meant] on the coasts of Kamchatka and the Kurile Islands, the waters also lashed Bering Island to a height greater than 30 sazhene [64 m]</p><p>(above from reference #413) </p><p>Reference #11787 states the following regarding Georg W. Steller account included in reference #413: &#34;The abbreviation f or ft instead of the word foot (feet), which was interpreted by the clerks as fathom.&#34; &#34;Finally, in the Russian translation of the fair copy, fathom (1.83 m) was replaced by Russian fathom, or sazhen (2.13 m), a unit of length formerly used in Russia, and the already six times overestimated tsunami height (30 fathoms &#61; 54.9 m) was increased by another nine meters.&#34; &#34;Reality the height of the 1737 tsunami runup on Bering Island was hardly more than 3-4 m; only in individual narrow valleys of the rivers flowing into small and shallow bays could it have reached 8-10 m.&#34;</p>",

        "comments": "August 4, 1856, 16:47 [local time]. Suddenly, an earthquake destroyed settlements on the Atlantic coast of Honduras, approximately from Omoa to Beliz. The port of Omoa was almost totally destroyed. Many cracks appeared in the walls of the ancient Spanish fortress. The ground cracked in a radius of 50 km (12 leagues) in the vicinity of the city and on the coast between the Rio Tinto and Ulua Rivers. The town of San Jose was also destroyed, and Beliz suffered damage. Weak tremors lasting 30 seconds were felt at Guatemala. Underground shocks lasted all the night of the 4th-5th. Then for a week more than a hundred were counted, and they lasted at least until the 27th. The Indian tribes of Honduras long remembered this earthquake. At Omoa, the sea fell and rose to a height of 5 m in still weather; it reached the foot of the fortress and added to the destruction begun by the earthquake. A similar phenomenon was observed on the shore of Criba lagoon. (reference #415)\r\n<p>August 9, 1856, 16 N, 88 W, magnitude 7.5. Earthquakes (from August 4 to 14) damaged villages, on the Honduras coast from the banks of the Rio Tinto to Rio Ulna and Omoa, Livingston, Santo Tomas, Belize, Jamaica, and Guatemala City. Tsunami effects included the following: At Omoa, the sea fell and rose 5 m reaching the base of the fortress and adding to the earthquake damage. During violent trembling at the mouth of Rio Patuca, the water receded from the 8 km broad Criba lagoon toward the sea, leaving the bottom dry. The waters returned from every direction, rose in a column then fell and advanced toward the land. The tsunami carried whole trees, branches, and stones. Natives reported that water swept into the interior about 24 km. The tsunami affected several towns, including Cortez, Atlantida, and Trujillo. There were reports of rivers changing directions, probably due to bores. (reference #537)\r\n</p><p>August 4, 1856, 17:00 Local time. Magnitude 7-8. Based on the descriptions of this earthquake, you could be a high magnitude event with epicentral region in the Cayman Trench, between Honduras and Jamaica. According to the description of Montessus (1888) on the coast of Honduras a single jolt caused major damage in the port of Omoa, opening many cracks in the walls of an old Spanish citadel and on the ground in an area about 12 miles ( 50 km) radius between the deltas of the rivers Tinto and Ulua. The small town of San Jose, also was ruined. The sea withdrew and increase their return considerably damages. Montessus notes that this is a rare example of a tsunami in Central America; apparently came up with a seiche in the lagoon Sieve, according Boscowitz (1885), who collected testimonies from destruction of several towns, rivers that changed direction and many victims. (reference #124)\r\n</p><p>August 4, 1856, magnitude 7-8, Omoa, Honduras, Gulf of Honduras. This tsunami has been mistakenly associated with the Pacific coast of Honduras in Heck (reference #132). Omoa is a town on the Atlantic coast of Honduras. The tsunami affected several towns all along the Atlantic coast of that country, like Cortez, Atlantida, Trujillo, and Criba Lagoon. There are accounts of the complete ruin of Omoa, destruction of entire villages and rivers changing direction. This seems to be one of the largest tsunamis to have affected the Atlantic coast of Central America. (references #273 and 82)\r\n</p><p>August 4, 1856. El Salvador to Nicaragua.

Dr. Okal continued his presentation, agreeing that the tsunami that hit Omoa in 1856 was almost certainly from an earthquake-triggered landslide. (reference #12024)</p>",

The 19 to 23 February 2013 ITST covered 30 locations on 4 Islands: Ndendo (Santa Cruz), Tomotu Noi (Lord Howe), Nea Tomotu (Trevanion, Malo) and Tinakula. The tsunami impact peaked at Manoputi on Ndendo&#39;s densely populated west coast with maximum tsunami height exceeding 11 m and local flow depths above ground exceeding 7 m. A fast tide-like positive amplitude of 1 m was recorded at Lata wharf inside Graciosa Bay on Ndendo Island and misleadingly reported in the media as representative tsunami height. The stark contrast between the field observations on exposed coastlines and the Lata tide gauge recording highlights the importance of rapid tsunami reconnaissance surveys. Inundation distance and damage more than 500 m inland were recorded at Lata airport on Ndendo Island. Landslides were observed on volcanic Tinakula Island and on Ndendo Island.

The eruption was accompanied at different stages by oscillations of the water level in the bay.\r\n</p><p>The first strong earthquake struck on May 28 at about 13:20.\r\n</p><p>At about 14:00, the water in Rabaul Harbor quietly retreated 90 m from shore and then returned to its usual boundary. On Raluan Is, the water also retreated slowly, then flooded the shore to 140 m beyond the high high tideline, after which it returned to its usual mark, leaving many fish on shore. In Keravia Bay, at about 13:30, the water flooded a road, rising 1 1/2-2 m above the usual level.\r\n</p><p>On May 29, at about 5:30, a new shock was felt at Rabaul.\r\n</p><p>Between 8:00 and 9:00, an elevation of Kaluan Is was observed.\r\n</p><p>At 11:00, it was noticed that the reef south of Matupi Is had become exposed. This had never happened before.\r\n</p><p>At 13:10 the water off the west coast of Raluan Is became turbid and rough. At about the same time, the reef here dried up; the reef was hidden under water at 13:15, but it came to the surface again at 13:20. During the day, many residents collected fish on the reefs, and about 20 of these people died during the eruption.\r\n</p><p>The eruption of the volcano began at 16:15. The island and the adjacent sections of bottom began to rise quickly; the little islands in the passage began to grow and merge, and soon a broad isthmus formed between the island and the mainland. Then the volcano exploded, and a black pillar of ash and steam 9 m wide and 12 m high rose into the air. The column grew with each subsequent explosion, and reached a height of 3 km. Masses of flames the size of a room or smaller flew up to a height of 1.5 km and then fell to the earth or into the water with A deafening noise. There were no lava flows. The eruption of the Tawurwur Volcano began on May 30, after 13:00. The eruption lasted until the morning of the following day; about 2,300,000 cubic m of material was ejected. It also settled to the northwest of the volcano, that is, in the region of Rabaul, where the layer of ash was several cm thick...\r\n</p><p>During the first explosions of the Raluan Volcano, the underground shocks for the most part stopped. The water near Raluan Is was markedly agitated. At Rabaul, the water retreated 45 m several times, returned to the high high tide mark, and retreated again. Then the eruption was almost continuous for 3 hrs, but there were no noticeable oscillations in level.\r\n</p><p>Beginning at 19:00, the eruption began to pulsate, and periods of explosions began to alternate with periods of relative calm. It was precisely, during such a period of calm and before 21:00, that is, before the lip of the new crater of the volcano had completely risen above the water, that considerable oscillations in level were observed in the harbor. Four to five minutes passed between the rise and fall of the water. The amplitude of at least three of the waves was 2-2.5 m above and below the mean water level. A schooner was run aground by the wave onto a small pier and then dragged to the depths of the bay together with the pier. Several boats ran aground, and one or two sank. Subsequently, the oscillations apparently diminished, but their range was still 1/2 m early in the morning on the 30th. \r\n</p><p>During the eruption, <b>more than 500 people perished, including those who drowned</b>. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1412:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1937, May 29.

        "comments": "1821, May. In the year 1821, I was a midshipman in his majesty&#39;s ship Vigo, guard-ship at St. Helena, bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Lambert, and commanded by Cap. Thomas Brown, during the latter period of Napoleon&#39;s exile. I had charge of an excellent establishment on shore, called the stockyard, for keeping a supply of fat cattle for the squadron after its arrival from the Cape, lank and lean. My party of men always slept on board, landing the next morning at daylight. It was in the early part of May, a month rendered remarkable by the death of the great chieftain, which took place on the 5th day, that we were pulling in as usual the launch, with several working parties on board, but observing that the surf was too violent for the large boat filled with men, to attempt a landing, we tried to accomplish it by a few at a time, in the jolly boat. A small number, including myself, got on shore in this manner. Shortly after I was engaged in conversation with an officer of the Hon. Company&#39;s ship Ganges, surrounded by native women, some children, and Lascars, when I felt myself forcibly pulled by the arm, and heard a person exclaim--&#34;Look at the horizon, run, save yourself, we shall all be lost!&#34; I did look, and the sight I shall never cease to remember, it was so frightfully grand. On the horizon, from the north-west, appeared an immense undulation, or swell, resembling a bank of water rolling majestically in, directly in the wind&#39;s eye. Whether it was my anxiety for the boats, or that astonishment had paralyzed me, I cannot tell, but I felt riveted to the spot alone, and before I could attempt to save myself, as others did, by climbing the rocks I was whirled along with the rapidity of lightning, in the midst of this dark wave.\r\n<p>&#34;Almost in an instant I experienced a violent shock, which stunned me for a few moments; on recovering the perfect use of my senses, I found myself in the armourer&#39;s cave, with the forge lying across my thigh. To this circumstance I must draw attention, as, by its weight keeping me from going into the sea as the water receded, and from being dashed against the rocks, to it I owe my preservation. Near me were lying two Lascars, one was split up the middle, the other&#39;s skull was beat to pieces--<b>both were dead</b>. Fearing a return of the surf, as the sea usually runs in quickly twice, and then comes with redoubled violence, I made the best use of my lungs; the carpenter fortunately heard my cries, and rescued me. My clothes were torn to shreds, my ears, eyes, and nose, filled with ashes and blood; but with the exception of a few contusions, and lacerated hands, I was otherwise unhurt. <b>One woman was drowned</b>, and several men and children were picked up by the boats.\r\n</p><p>&#34;This first swell that I have mentioned was the prelude to a gigantic surf, which lasted three days. This phenomenon (as nothing like it had ever taken place in the memory of the oldest inhabitants) was attributed to an <b>earthquake</b>. We had only telegraphic communication with the ship while it lasted. The fortifications were much injured in front of St. James Town; huge rocks were torn up and tossed into our little bathing place to the left of the landing; the guard-house was abandoned the sea reaching the upper windows; the ships rode with sails aback, to keep them astern of their anchors; and, while it lasted, to see the mass of water burst upon the cliffs, as if to shake the island from its foundation, was the grandest sight I ever beheld.&#34;</p><p>(above from reference #4222)</p>",

We can see that there are many other scars left of rockfalls of unknown origin. This rockslide must have triggered a tsunami (Murty and Durvasula 1977) in a context illustrated in Figure 2d.

Speaking to Tasnim on Tuesday morning, Mohammad Hassan Basti, a deputy to governor of Iran&#39;s southern province of Bushehr, said the body of an eight-year-old boy was retrieved from the pier of Dayyer on Monday evening. He was the second victim among a total of six people lost in the deadly sea storm and subsequent flooding that hit Dayyer on Sunday, he noted. According to Basti, 22 people have been wounded in the incident, 80 dwellings have been destroyed, urban infrastructure has been damaged, and some 200 boats have been wrecked in the natural disaster. Head of Bushehr&#39;s Persian Gulf Oceanography Centre Ehsan Abedi had announced that the reason behind the giant waves and the sea overflow was a natural phenomenon called Seiche, saying it occurs when strong winds push water and cause water levels to drop at one end and rise at the other.\r\n</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11970:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>On 19 March 2017, a series of waves from the Persian Gulf inundated significant parts of the Port of Dayyer on the southern coastlines of Iran (Fig. 1), some time between 8:00 and 8:20 AM local time (4:30-4:50 GMT). It resulted in one death and five people missing, and reportedly capsized about 300 boats and caused ~$10 million of damage. According to Iranian state media, water progressed as far as ~1 km in land and video footage recorded by local individuals or seasonal travelers reveals surges of up to  2 m in a relatively calm, cloudy morning, even though a significant thunderstorm had occurred a few hours earlier.

The earliest information about the earthquake of 10 September 1509 in the Sea of Marmara comes from a letter written five days after the event, dated 15 Sept 1509, by Nicolo Zustignan a Venetian in Istanbul. There can be no doubt that the correct date of the earthquake is 10 Sept 1509, at about 10 at night in the New Style (N.S.), and that, from what has already been said the date 14 Sept assigned to the event by most writers is erroneous. As a result of the earthquake, in some places in Istanbul and Pera the ground opened up and fissured, presumably along the coast of the Golden Horn. Also as a result of the earthquake the sea retreated from the shore and then returned, flooding the coast over a very large area at places that are not named. When the sea came back to its previous place, the ground near the coast opened up and was left fissured. This phenomenon was observed on both sides of the Golden Horn on the coasts of Istanbul and Pera. Modern writers claim that as a result of the earthquake the sea overtopped the sea walls of the city. This information comes from later authors, who say that the sea in the Golden Horn was so strongly shaken that it was thrown over the walls of Istanbul and Galata killing 12000 people. There is no indication <i>in primary sources</i> that the flooding of the coast of the Golden Horn by the sea at the time of the earthquake caused any damage or that the Sea of Maramara flooded the south coast of the city.

The related earthquake occurred on February 2, 1703 at L&#39; Aquila (Central Apennines) causing very strong damages and fatalities in all the region. The epicentral area was located inland about 100 km from the Tevere river mouth. Going back to coeval sources, the belief that the link between the earthquake and the tsunami is quite casual rises stronger. This conviction is supported by the fact that the information on the withdrawal is reported only by Baglivi [ref #10545]: &#34;...at the time of the second shock they say that the latin sea it the mouth of the Tevere river near the harbour, wandered away from the shore just for a little; at the end of the earthquake the water immediately came back&#34;. All other coeval authors did not notice anything about the sea regression... Concluding, the distance from the earthquake epicentre and the limitation of the indirect testimony, leaves many doubts on the reliability of the sea effect.

However, the quantitative data on the height of the waves on these islands are contradictory.

At the time of the most severe shocks, the ocean receded in the epicentral zone, only to rise and advance upon the shore again and again. In Valparaiso, at the time of a full ebb, the sea suddenly rose and just as suddenly receded. A launch from the admiral&#39;s ship, which was on its way to render assistance to people on shore, was thrown up to the gates of the customs house, located 3.5 m higher than the ordinary high tide mark. Suddenly, the sea began to recede very rapidly, stranding small vessels and boats. All this occurred within 15 minutes. Several minutes later, a second wave of reduced intensity appeared. In all, three large floods and ebbs of a height of 3.6 m (12 feet) were recorded. On the morning of the 20th, the sea level fluctuations were normal again. (reference #415)\r\n<p>1822 Nov. 19. Chile. Epicenter about 15 miles north of Valparaiso. Waves were reported along the coast from Rio Copiapo to Valdivia. The sea near Valparaiso rose to great heights, then receded so far that small boats were left dry upon the strand. It continued rising and falling to a gradually diminished extent for a quarter of an hour. The earthquake was also felt on board ships lying off Callao. Melipilla, Quillota, and Casablanca were destroyed by the earthquake. (reference #39)\r\n</p><p>1822, Nov. 19. During the first shock on the night of Nov. 19, the sea in Valparaiso harbour rose to a great height, so as to carry boats farther in than any boat had been before. It then receded so as to leave the small vessels, that were afloat before, dry on the beach. A few minutes later, there was a second wave, though not reaching the level of the first, possibly on account of the rise of about 3 ft. in the bed of the harbour. The seawaves were of short duration and, after a quarter of an hour, ceased to be noticeable. (reference #516)\r\n</p><p>1822, Nov 19, 10:15 pm local time.

The bay alternately dried up quickly, then filled with water. A ship riding at anchor at a depth of 9 m sat on the bottom twice.

The seaquake was very strong. Then at 8:10, the sea which had risen quickly surged off to the southeast with unbelievable speed. During the strongest ebb, the depth of water fell to 7 m. After this, at still greater speed than it retreated, the water rose and ran 65 proas around which a few minutes prior had been left on dried bottom. Then the water once again surged back with terrible speed, destroying and carrying away everything. Twenty minutes after, the water rose again; the depth of the water was 14.5 m. This time the wave was as much stronger and more fearsome as it was higher. It inundated the breakwater and the embankment, where most of the crews of the proas had taken refuge, and carried them off. <b>Sixty people died</b>. Many proas, small and large, were tossed onto the embankment and destroyed. Buildings standing on the embankment were washed away. After this the water fell 8 m.

Upon seeing that the sea differed from usual the villagers evacuated to Hirohachiman Shrine, fearing a tsunami, but were relieved to see that no damage had occurred. However early afternoon of the next day, a villager rushed into Goryou&#39;s home and said, &#34;It&#39;s a crisis! The well water has run dry!&#34; At 4:00 in the evening, a huge earthquake incomparable to the one of the previous day occurred. Houses fell down and roof tiles were blown off. People repeatedly heard sounds like the roar of cannons, and dark cirrus clouds rapidly spread. Finally a huge tsunami rushed toward the village. &#34;Run! Head up the hill! A tsunami is coming!&#34; Swallowed by the waves, Goryou frantically yelled at the villagers and urged them to evacuate to Hirohachiman Shrine. The tsunami traveled up the river washing away houses and agricultural fields, and then returned to the sea at frightening speed. Left around them was a hopeless sight. Adults and children alike were milling around calling for and trying to find their families. Goryou noticed there must be people wandering around in the dark, unsure of where to evacuate to. Suddenly he thought, &#34;I know, I&#39;ll set fire to the rice sheaves up on the hill, even if it is a bit wasteful,&#34; and he set fire to the rice sheaves. Drawn by the fire the villagers who had failed to escape then started arriving on the hill one after another. &#34;Oh, I was saved because of the fire.&#34; Just as the 9th villager reached the safety zone, a tsunami much bigger than before rushed toward the village and also extinguished the fire of rice sheaves.</p>",

On Sangihe Is, after a sudden &#34;unbearable&#34; roar, the Awu Volcano began to erupt. Incandescent lava rushed down the slopes of the mountain with irresistible force, destroying everything in its path. Where the lava reached the shore, the sea water began to boil. Strong hot springs gushed up and the abundant surging boiling water destroyed and carried away everything that the fire had spared. \r\n</p><p>The sea surged onto the shore cliffs as during an underwater earthquake, and with a terrifying noise, it flooded the coast and &#34;snatched its victims from the fire.&#34;\r\n</p><p>An hour later, thunderous blows were heard, shaking the earth. A black column of ash and stones was ejected from the peak of the mountain. The column rose to the &#34;heavens&#34; and fell in a rain of fire on the slopes of the volcano, which were lit up by the red hot lava. Total darkness\r\nfell, in which one could not make out the closest objects; it was interrupted from time to time by outbreaks of light. Large bombs fell to the earth. The settlements and fields not destroyed by the lava were buried under a layer of ash and rocks. The flows rushed down from the mountain, and, encountering obstacles, spread out in lakes, which then became a new source of destruction.</p><p>All this took several hours. By midnight, all had quieted down, although the eruption began with new force the next noon. The ashfall continued all day and was so intensive that no light could penetrate, and almost total darkness set in.</p><p>A hurricane southeastern wind blew since the beginning of the eruption, and the ashes were carried as far as Mindanao Island. Later the wind blew from the north.</p><p>On March 17, there was a new eruption, in which fields and trees on the coast at Tabukan were destroyed. After this, the volcano quieted down, except that steam continuously rose from the numerous cracks and fractures. However, the lava flows were still so hot that one could not approach them. According to residents, the top of the volcano did not change noticeably in appearance.</p><p>At the main village of the island, Tahuna, several people were injured and homes were destroyed during the fall of ash and stones. Obstacles in the form of hills made the lava flow deviate from the village and turn to the sea in another place.</p><p>Along the flat slope between Tahuna and Kandhar, seven large lava flows descended to the sea, devastating this agricultural region. One of the flows passed through Kalongan village; only a few burned posts were left. Between Kalongan and Kandhar, a large area of the coast subsided below sea level. The mountain side had previously sloped gently to the very water line; after the eruption, it broke off as a steep wall about 60 m (200 feet) high.</p><p>The settlement of Kandhar, protected by this &#34;rib,&#34; suffered little: it was affected only by the fall of ashes and stones and the streams of hot water. In addition, before the eruption, the residents, fearing pirates, had hidden with their belongings in the thickets above the settlement, and did not suffer from the flooding.</p><p>The devastation was even greater on the coast from Kandhar to the northern tip of the island. Two tongues of lava thrust far into the sea to previous bottom marks of several metres (fathoms).</p><p><b>The number of victims was considerable: at Tahuna 722, at Kandhar 22, at Tabukan 2,039; total 2,806. For the most part, the people died in the gardens where they sought relief  from the heat. Those who attempted to run, were overtaken by flows of lava and water, perished under collapsing trees, were suffocated or were burned in the ashfall and the fires. At Kalongan and Tariang, the residents who took refuge in their houses died in the debris. Finally, those who took to the sea shore &#34;fell prey to vicious waves&#34;.</b></p>",

On 26 February at 19 h local time (27 February 00 h 36 m UT) a tidal wave flooded the coast of Ahuachapan in El Salvador from Garita Palmera to Barra del Paz and beyond, a distance of about 120 km. The height of the wave is not mentioned, but allegedly about 100 persons were drowned at San Diego and 85 at Barra del Paz. Some property damage was caused on the coast of Acajutla and Cara Sucia. Some writers associate this event with a spurious earthquake on 1902 February 26 (Cruz &amp; Wyss 1983, reference #82) or with the earthquake of 1903 April 19. However, there is evidence that this <i><b>wave was not triggered by an earthquake, but rather that it was the result of a combination of a high tide and abnormal meteorological conditions</b></i><b> (Anderson 1908, reference #7975; List 1903, reference #8016). Most of the earthquakes associated with seismic sea waves are located just off the coast or a few tens of km inland at distances from the shore comparable with their source dimensions. It is not clear whether these waves were due to tectonic movements of the seabed; the evidence for some off the southeast coast of Costa Rica points to submarine slumping or to their being seiches set up in Fonseca, Nicoya and Chiriqui bays. (reference #8015)\r\n<p>1902, Feb 26. 13.5 N 89.5 W, validity likely, tsunami magnitude 2.  On February 26, the residents of the Pacific coast border regions of Guatemala and El Salvador heard a loud rumble, like cannon shots, which appeared to come from under the bottom of the sea. A strong earthquake then occurred. Soon the residents saw the water retreating, exposing the sea bottom for a considerable distance. After this, a black wall arose at sea: this was a large wave, whose might increased as it approached the shore. The wave surged onshore with terrifying force. The residents did not have time to run to safety and they perished. The tsunami was observed on a 120-km stretch of coast which included Acajutla, Ecuador. <b>One hundred people died and about the same number were injured</b> at Barra de Santiago settlement. About <b>85 people died</b> at the village of Barra del Pas. Homes and trees were washed out to sea, and the clothes were ripped from people caught by the water.

The tidal waves which arose were observed along the entire coast from Heldsbuch on the north to Busega in Huon Gulf, and also on the islands of Tami, Siassi and Umboi. According to observations at Finsh Harbor, about 15 minutes after the earthquake the sea &#34;began to rumble&#34; and a larger roller surged in, as a result of which the water level rose 1.2-1.5 m above the flood tide mark. The lowlying part of the coast was flooded, and the dike between the land and Madang Island, which was built of large coral blocks, was washed out. &#34;Freezing&#34; for 1/2 minute, the flood tide receded just as quickly and unexpectedly as it had appeared and the subsequent ebb tide was a good 1.5 m lower than the strongest equinoctial ebb tides. The flood tide recurred many times, but an unusually low level of the sea in general obtained until 10:00. Only after that did the water again return slowly to its normal level. The inhabitants of the villages on the islands escaped to &#34;the big land&#34; from the oncoming flood tide and dared to return to their homes only many days later.

According to observations in Finschhafen, the sea roared enormously for about 15 min after the first tremor and a spring tide appeared. The water level rose to 1.2 to 1.5 m above highest sea-level mark, and the low-lying coastal areas were flooded;a causeway constructed from massive coral blocks from the mainland to the island of Madang was completely washed away. After remaining at the highest level for half a minute, the flood ran off as quickly as it appeared. After remaining at the highest level for about half a minute, the flood ran of as quickly as it appeared. The following low tide was about 1.5 m below the normal spring low tide during the change of the monsoon. The high tide returned several times; the unusual low tide remained until 10 a.m. Thereafter the water level rose slowly to normal. The natives from the island villages, Quamquam, Sisalum, etc., fled from the flood wave to the mainland and did not return to their villages for days. Especially important may be the report from Missionary J.S. Pfalzer (observation by Missionary Hansche) that no flood wave occurred on the island of Ruk; on the contrary the water retreated there. Is there not a possibility that sudden submarine slumping may have caused the movement of the water masses? Also Missionary G. Bamler locates the epicentre between Kaiser Wilhelm Land and Neu-Pommern and considers a block down thrust. In this connection it also remarkable that according to Missionary Hansche, on the day before the earthquake, on September 14th, smoke emerged from the volcano on the island of Tupinier. \r\n</p><p>1906, Sept 15, 01:30 [local time].

A severe earthquake at 10:14 Local Time in the Mona Passage, west of Puerto Rico was caused by displacement along four segments of a normal fault, oriented N-S in the Mona Canyon (Ref #267). A tsunami with runup heights reaching 6 m followed the earthquake, causing extensive damage along the western and northern coasts of Puerto Rico, especially to those villages established in a flood plain. \r\n<p>Many of the runup heights associated with this event were measured by Reid and Taber (Ref #1078) using water marks on visible objects. Other heights were provided by reliable witnesses who were interviewed by Reid and Taber during their visit to Puerto Rico and St. Thomas for four weeks in late 1919.\r\n</p><p>In the disastrous tsunami that lashed the northwest coast at Aguadilla in 1918, 30 People were said to have drowned at Aguadilla alone. This was later revised to\r\n32 victims, The eight deaths of victims drowned at Punta Agujereada by the waves 5.5 to 6 meters in height brought the initial tally of people drowned for these two locations to 40. The greatest number of fatalities was said to be from\r\nthe tsunami, The official death toll for this event was placed at 116. This total must have been earthquake fatalities only, since at Mayagiiez, &#34;more than 100&#34;\r\ndeaths were reported, plus the 4 deaths at Ponce (totaling 104). When added to the tsunami victim count of 40, this would tally 144. In 1997, Mercado Irizarry (personal communication, 1997a) updated the tsunami death toll, with the report October 11, 1918, Puerto Rico of an account by an &#34;old, very well known gentleman in Aguadilla.&#34; He said,\r\n&#34;deaths should have exceeded 100. The reason was that many persons were unaccounted for and, therefore, not included in the official toll.&#34; Even more recently, Dillon et al. (1999) reported that 91 people were killed by the tsunami\r\nin northwestern Puerto Rico. With the significantly higher totals of those who perished from the waves, the total fatalities for the disaster from both the earthquake and tsunami approaches a number greater than 200.

Immediately following the shock a tsunami broke upon the shore, drowning many persons and destroying many native dwellings. Property damage was estimated at about $4 million and 116 lives were lost. (Ref #1128)</p><p>The October 11, 1918 Mona Passage earthquake triggered a tsunami\r\nthat affected the western coast of Puerto Rico. The cause of the tsunami was previously suggested to be due seafloor displacement by a normal fault on the eastern wall of the Mona Rift(Mercado and McCann, 1998). We have identified a submarine landslide with steep headwall and sidewalls scarps 15 km off the northwestern coast of Puerto Rico using\r\nnewly available multibeam bathymetry and multichannel seismic reflection profiles. Based on these new data we postulate that the landslide, which was induced by the earthquake, was responsible for the generation of the tsunami. Supporting this idea is the documented rupture of submarine telegraph cables by landslides in the area of our\r\nmapped landslide during the earthquake (Reid and Taber, 1919). The landslide, which is well marked by fresh and steep scarps, is 9 km wide by 9 km in length in the excavation area, and it has an average thickness of 140-150 m.

Damage to bridges and roads was at least $80,000. One fishing boat was wrecked. Several skiffs and fishing nets were lost ($4,000). At least 15 homes were damaged including three destroyed. Nine trailers were damaged and three cars were lost. One mile of sea bulkhead was lost.\r\n</p><p>In Oregon, four children were drowned and one woman suffered a fatal heart attack. Bridges, houses, trailers, cars, motel units and sea walls were destroyed at communities along the length of the coast. Damage estimates are uncertain but appear to be between $750,000 and $1,000,000. Most of the communities did not receive any warning.\r\n</p><p>In California there were thirteen fatalities including the death of a Wilmington longshoreman killed when a cable on a crane broke and dropped a loaded pallet on him. Twelve were injured in Crescent city during the early part of the disaster. Damage in California probably exceeded $17,000,000. Crescent City was the worst affected with about $15,000,000 of the damage occurring there. About $1,000,000 occurred inside San Francisco bay due to currents, a major source of damage on the southern California Coast. Late arriving surges also caused one death and considerable damage.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #239:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>The passage of seismic waves are a known cause of seiche at great distances from the source where the waves have had time to disperse.

Here, on the 40 km stretch between Shioya and Nezugaseki, the maximum rise of water was 4 m with individual waves up to 6 m. The rise of water was also considerable at Ryotsu, south of the source, on the northern shore of Sado Island, at the top of a bay of triangular shape. The gradual narrowing of the bay caused a rise of water of 3 m at Ryotsu compared with 1-1.5 m at the entrance to the bay.</p><p>The rise of water was no more that 1-2 m at other points in Japan. A survey of the effects of the tsunami showed some unusual local intensifications and attenuations of intensity which do not correlate with coastal relief, but were due to the dissipating or concentrating; effect of the underwater relief between the source and the coast.

        "comments": "On December 12, 1979 at 07:59:4.3 UTC a major earthquake measuring 7.9 occurred along the Pacific Coast of Colombia. The earthquake and tsunami associated with it were responsible for the destruction of at least six fishing villages and the death of hundreds of people in the Narino State of Colombia. At least 15 other coastal towns in the area were rocked by the earthquake and were damaged by the waves. Waves measuring anywhere from 2-5 meters destroyed many of these coastal villages. People along the coast, who survived the earthquake by running outside their homes, were carried away a few minutes later by the large tsunami waves generated by the earthquake. Six fishing boats, one with 40 men aboard, were lost. A pier on the prison island of Gorgona was destroyed, however, no injuries from either the earthquake or the tsunami were reported from there. Most of the houses at Charco, a village of 4,000 which were built on stilts over a lake were knocked into the water. Waves sent the Iscuande River out of its banks along the Pacific coast. The wall of water reportedly in the village of Iscuande caused extensive damages. At least one person was reported dead from that area.\r\n<p>Hardest hit of all the coastal villages was the fishing village of San Juan, where the waves completely overran the island destroying just about everything in their path. Numerous deaths were reported from San Juan which was totally devastated and is in the process of being relocated further inland at the present time. According to eyewitness reports, 3 to 4 waves were observed, the first wave arriving approximately 10 minutes after the main earthquake. The water recessed first to about 3 meters below the level of the sea. The first wave arrived minutes later. The third wave was the largest, and at San Juan Island it was approximately 5 meters above the level of the tide, which fortunately, was at its lowest at that time.\r\n</p><p>The maximum difference between low and high tide in the region for that time of the year was approximately 1.3 meters, thus, the maximum wave could have been that much more, if it had arrived at high tide, and numerous more deaths could have resulted. Considering that the mean elevation of the coastal islands is approximately 2 to 2.5 meters above high tide, it would mean that maximum waves would have completely overrun all of the coastal islands in the area. Approximately 30-35 km of the coast was hardest hit by the tsunami, while the length of the area hardest hit by the earthquake was approximately 225 km in length, from Guapi to Tumaco.\r\n</p><p><b>It is estimated that the majority of casualties (at least 80%) were the result of the tsunami rather than of the earthquake. An ITIC estimate based on informal reports is that 500-600 people may have been killed by the combined effects of the earthquake and tsunami with about 4,000 people injured. Homes of at least 10,000 persons were destroyed.</b>\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #3330)\r\n</p><p>The tsunami caused great damage, and was similar in scope to the event of January 31, 1906. Ramirez and Goberna (1980) note that the wave arrived 3 minutes after the earthquake, at San Juan de la Costa. The only death toll from the tsunami is from Tumaco (36 deaths). There may have been other deaths from the tsunami, but they have been included with the earthquake counts by disaster agencies.\r\n</p><p>Ephemeral Island 10.8N, 75.4W. An island 30 meter long, 5 meter wide and 7 meter high was formed during the night of December 12, 1979 in the Caribbean Sea, 300 meters off the coast of Punta Canoa, Colombia. The sawtoothed island was composed to greenish-gray clay, apparently squeezed upward through a fissure. By Dec 29, the island was only half its initial size and disappeared under the pounding of strong waves on Jan 9, 1980. The Caribbean coast of Colombia is well-known for its mud volcanoes, which\r\nhave &#34;eruptions&#34; driven by petroleum gases.

Rather, we show that the model of an underwater landslide, presumably triggered by the earthquake, and taking place on the steep slopes of the continental shelf approximately 10 km offshore, can fit the principal inundation characteristics identified during the survey[...]The testimony of our witnesses confirms that a tsunami did take place following the 1990 Rudbar earthquake, the largest event recorded in northern Iran in modern times, even though it remained relatively modest and its flooding resulted in no significant damage or casualties.

        "comments": "The tsunami hazard in Futuna is poorly documented. The only historical tsunami is associated with the 12 March 1993, MW 6.4 earthquake that caused \u223c0.5 m uplift of the reef along the southern coast of Futuna (Regnier, 1994). A small tsunami was reported along Futuna&#39;s south coast but no further observations of the wave were noted (Monzier et al., 1993; Capecchi, 1995). Immediate post-1993 earthquake studies focused on the extensive damage caused by the event including the destruction of every church greater than 100 years old. An earlier earthquake in 1840, with strong ground shaking and intense building damage, was described by the missionary station of St Pierre Chanel, but no tsunami was noted. In addition to historical records, some oral traditions provide tantalising evidence of prehistoric events that may have been catastrophic tsunamis, but age estimates are unclear (Di Piazza and Frimigacci, 1991). While sparse, the data discussed above indicate that the tsunami hazard is real, and the risk for the population who live almost exclusively along the low-lying coast is high. (reference #6956)\r\n<p>The shock was followed by a small tidal wave, localized at  Leava Bay, which caused extensive damage on boats who were there. On this subject, it is noted the authorities broadcasted by radio shortly after the start of the crisis, a message advising people to climb the mountain following the strong earthquake. The Futunians have fully complied with this instruction, fleeing the high part of the island after the earthquake of 13 March (the message being broadcast only Futunan, Europeans were generally not in present and therefore do not respond ...). Although in this case no significant tidal wave happened this evacuation along the coastal plain is be considered still valid in the event of strong shaking (it is not needed to stay more than 1 or 2 hours in the mountains, the tidal wave, in this case, having a local origin and thus occurring a few minutes after the earthquake). (reference #11511)\r\n</p><p>March 12, 1993 earthquake Futuna (14,248 2 S 178 298 2 W,Mb &#61; 5.9, Ms &#61; 6.5 PDE) killed three people. Caused damage to structures all over the island. It produced numerous landslides onshore all around the island, offshore and triggered a small tsunami. It likely caused uplift on the island by at least 50 cm as shown by the newly uplifted coral reefs along the southern coast. (reference #11520)</p>",

Considerable damage also occurred in the Maliana region. The ITIC reported that they received a report from Indonesia that\r\nthis was a subsidence and no one saw a wave return. In an email on May 30, Prasetya said, &#34;We conclude that no tsunamis have been generated directly by the earthquake which was reported by the newspaper to have occurred on 14 May 1995. The wave run-up occurred at some places due to land subsidence in coastal areas.&#34; There is probably a problem with the understanding of the definition of\r\na tsunami.

Following intensive rescue efforts by local officials and other authorities from the Federation, numerous survivors were found, however, over 1,500 people lost their lives from this earthquake that reduced apartment buildings in Neftegorsk to heaps of\r\nrubble. The town of Neftegorsk, before the earthquake, had a\r\npopulation of 2,997. According to a preliminary report filed in early June by Alexei Ivashchenko and Victor Kaistrenko, two Federation scientific investigation teams comprised of the Seismological Party and Institute of Marine Geology and Geophysics are at the earthquake\r\nregion collecting macroseismic data and traces of possible\r\nsmall tsunami. One group reported that a small but not distinct tsunami due to this event occurred on the Okhotsk Sea coast near the settlements of Sabo and Val according to information from fishermen that were on the coast the night of the event. They  reported that near Sabo &#34;ice on the Okhotsk sea started to go to the coast after the earthquake&#34;, and, near Val, &#34;water waves came to the river mouth after the earthquake.&#34; Another report stated there was small wave action of about 20 cm near the mouth of the Sabo River in the Piltun Gulf. Preliminary information from the nearest tide gauge at Nogliki (about 150 km to the south from Neftegorsk) indicates no tsunami was recorded. \r\nA Japanese seismological team has joined the tearns from\r\nRussia and have installed a local seismic network that is\r\nregistering about 500 (small) aftershocks per day.

        "comments": "On September 14, 1953 at 12:17 [local time] there was an earthquake and tsunami on the Fiji Islands. <b>Two persons perished, one under a landslide, the other by the collapse of a building.</b>\r\n<p>According to eyewitnesses, the water level at the entrance to the harbour of Suva began to recede immediately after the seismic shocks. The wave height reached 2 m (6 feet). The dock area was devastated; a supporting wall was severely damaged as a result of blows on mooring bollards and wall embrasures, and several yachts and boats were sunk.\r\n</p><p>In the opinion of Houtz, the wave resulted from currents &#34;descending&#34; from both slopes into the inlet channel and their collision in the channel. Depth surroundings carried out after the earthquake indicated that the water level along the edges of the inlet, which was flanked by steep coral reefs, had risen by 24 m (80 feet), whereas, in the channel it had dropped by 7 1/2 m (25 feet). \r\n</p><p>Two waves arrived at the island of Mbengga: one with a height of 0.3 m arrived 30 seconds after the earthquake, the other with a height of 1.2-1.5 m (4-5 feet) arrived 15 minutes after the quake.\r\n</p><p>The second wave, like the tidal wave at Nakasaleka on the island of Kandavu, which was observed 12 minutes after the earthquake, and like the wave that approached Navua and Laucala 15 minutes after the earthquake, evidently was generated in an area northeast of the island of Mbengga. After the earthquake, variations in the water level of up to 100 m (300 feet) were determined by echo sounding. It is\r\npossible that turbidity currents played a part in generating the wave, since underwater cables in the area of the epicenter were displaced, broken and buried under loose alluvium. On the basis of the damage the cables had suffered, the velocity of the bottom currents was estimated to be 10-20 knots. It should be noted that the main tsunami started on the southern coast off the island of Viti-Levu, at low tide, whereas the times of the wave passage referred to above correspond to the high tide which followed.\r\n</p><p>The tsunami was observed within a radius of approximately 330 km (180 miles) from the indicated center. \r\n</p><p>The waves were observed on the island of Kandavu and west of the island of Lau.\r\n</p><p>The waves had their greatest height, by various estimates, from 3 to 15 m (10-50 feet) at the reefs bordering the southern coast of Viti-Levu. The first wave was the strongest.  The approaching waves could be seen at distances of 2-4 km from the beach. Huge pieces of coral reef were thrown up onto dry land.\r\n</p><p>In a number of places, coastal villages and individual houses were seriously damaged. <b>In Suva, three persons were drowned in the tsunami waves and two on the island of Kandavu. Twelve persons received serious injuries.</b> The general property damage from the tsunami amounted to approximately one tenth of that caused by the earthquake. \r\n</p><p>The tsunami was recorded by tidal gauges in Pago Pago, where it had an amplitude of 20 cm (0.7 feet); in Honolulu where the wave had an amplitude of 6 cm (0.2 feet), a period of 16 minutes, and appeared in 7.3 hours after the earthquake; in Port Allen where it had an amplitude of\r\napproximately 10 cm; and in Hilo where it had a smaller amplitude.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)\r\n</p><p>Reference #79 lists five killed.\r\n</p><p>Damage caused directly as a result of the 1953 tsunami has been estimated at about $50,000 (1953 values). Damage was caused to the wharf facilities in Suva, roads, seawalls, bridges and buildings. The above estimate of damage refers only to Government structures and . no effective estimate of the losses to private holdings was made (Houtz, 1962). Three people were drowned in Suva as a result of the tsunami and two more on Kadavu island. (reference #11911)</p>",

The mound appears to be 20 to 40 feet (6 to 12 m) high and 100 feet (30 m) wide, DIG Gwadar Moazzam Jah, a district police officer, told Pakistan&#39;s Geo News. It rose out of the sea at a spot located about 350 feet (100 m) from the coast, he said...  A mud volcano is a likely possibility because Gwadar&#39;s coastline already has several of the gurgling, steamy cones, both onshore and at sea... And in 1945, the magnitude-8.1 Makran temblor triggered the formation of mud volcanoes offshore of Gwadar, according to a study on mud volcanoes in Pakistan published in 2005. A recent study in the journal Nature Geoscience also suggests the 1945 earthquake released tons of methane from the seafloor...But Geologist Dave Petley, a landslide expert, thinks the island&#39;s low, arcuate (or bow) shape - as seen in the few pictures released so far - suggests a rotational landslide, rather than a conical mud volcano.(reference #10751)\r\n<p>Three tide gauges and one DART station in the Arabian Sea observed the tsunami.

(reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>This earthquake triggered a tsunami that was recorded by various sea-level tide gauges along the coastal regions of the Arabian Sea and tsunami buoys in the Arabian Sea[...]The sudden uplift of the mud island might have caused the tsunami generation, which was clearly mapped by the backward ray tracing technique in this case study. The sudden uplift of mud island or submarine slumping might have caused the tsunami generation,which could be clearly mapped by the backward ray tracing technique as admissible tsunamigenic source. (reference #12691)\r\n</p><p>The modest tsunami recorded at the buoy and at Muscat (Oman)and Chah Bahar (Iran) was generated not by slip on the megathrust or a related splay fault but on a fault within the Makran accretionary prism, which is being shortened and uplifted by subduction.

There was a catastrophic eruption of the Krakatau volcano, which was accompanied by an enormous tsunami. The maximal height of rise of water was 30 m on the shores of the Sunda Strait, 4 m on the south coast of Sumatra Island, 2-2 1/2 m on the northern and southern shores of Java Island, 1/2-1 m in the Pacific Ocean as far as South America. In Indonesia, 36,000 people died. The main eruption was preceded by less strong ones on the 26th at 17:07 and 19:00-23:00, the 27th at 1:42, 5:30 and 6:44, which were also accompanied by less intensive tsunamis. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #236:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1883, August 27, 02:59. The explosive eruption of the volcano, Krakatau in the Sunda Strait, produced air-pressure waves, which were recorded by the Honolulu tide gage as a 0.2-m wave. These are not considered to be tsunami waves. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #237:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1883, August 27, 0259 GMT. The explosion of the Krakatau Volcano in Indonesia generated a 30-m tsunami in the Sundra Strait that destroyed numerous towns and killed about 36,000 people. The explosion was heard about 3,000 miles away. It also caused an atmospheric pressure wave that was recorded on the tide gages at remote locations including South Georgia Island, Panama, France, England, Hawaii, Alaska, and San Francisco. Due to the shadowing by continents and island groups, a direct tsunami could not have reached most of these locations. Harkrider and Press (1967) show that the direct air waves (acoustic) are the first to be recorded. Atmospheric gravity waves with phase and group velocities nearer the oceanic gravity wave velocity (sqrt(gd)) occurred and may have excited water waves (tsunamis) by transferring energy to the ocean. The longer the fetch, the more energy that would be transferred.\r\nThese waves are the most energetic and are created beyond the land mass shadow zones. The initial acoustic waves, too, may create resonances in the coastal and harbor areas as seiches. To consider these to be true tsunamis is a stretch of the definition but atmospheric gravity waves are or may be a source for tidal disturbance which resemble tsunamis.  It was recorded with an amplitude of six inches at Sausalito.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #9779:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>The voluminous pyroclastic flows entered the sea where they generated tsunami, and may have produced secondary explosion\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2990:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>The largest and most devastating volcanic tsunami of the last 250 years was produced by the Aug 26, 1883 eruption of Krakatoa volcano. This extremely energetic explosive eruption produced multiple tsunami waves was much as 37 m high, among the greatest tsunami waves seen in recent historic time. The waves raised large ships to 10 m above sea level and carried them as far as 3 km inland. These waves deluged more than 250 villages in western Java and eastern Sumatra killing more than 36,000 people. Fatalities due to waves occurred as far as 800 km from the volcano. Small tsunami waves were recorded throughout the Pacific Ocean, and small sea level oscillations were measured at sites thousands of kilometers away in the Indian Ocean, France and England. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #4653:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>Krakatoa exploded August 27, 1883 obliterating 5 square miles of land and leaving a crater 3.5 miles across and 200-300 meters deep. Thirty three feet high tsunami waves hit Anjer and Merak demolishing the towns and killing over 10,000 people. In Merak the wave rose to 135 feet above sea level and moved 100 ton coral blocks up on the shore.\r\nTsunami waves swept over 300 coastal towns and villages killing 40,000 people.

The landslide and flood at Vaiont Reservoir in northeast Italy is a famous engineering disaster caused by the failure to manage the effects of reservoir filling upon the stability of Monte Toc, just to the south. The disaster was unusual in that dam collapse did not trigger the ensuing flood. Rather, a catastrophic landslip from the slope of Monte Toc pushed ~1/5 of the water in the newly created reservoir overtop and around the dam. The 2.6x10<sup>8</sup> m<sup>3</sup> slide mass flung down 30 million cubic meters of water to flood the Piave Valley below. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #10992:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1963, October 9. The Vajont Landslide occurred at 10.39 pm in Italy, in the Dolomites of Friuli, on the borders of the Veneto Region and about 100 km north of Venice. A mass of approximately 270-300 million m<sup>3</sup> of rock and debris collapsed into the reservoir generating a wave that over-topped the 261.6 m high double curved arch dam built across a V-shaped gorge. The flood wave dropped into the Piave Valley destroying the town of Longarone and other villages nearby. <b>More than 2,000 people (the real number is not known) were killed</b>.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #10993:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1963, October 9. At 22:39 a huge landslide of about 270 million m<sup>3</sup> slid from Mount Toc into the Vajont artificial reservoir, in north-eastern Italy. The amount of water in the basin at that moment was about 115 million m<sup>3</sup>. The resulting displacement of water caused the generation of an impulse wave that spread throughout the basin. Its impressive wave run-up on the north slope of the lake, in front of Mount Toc, reached and <b>damaged buildings located in Casso</b> about 235 m over the original height of the lake surface. The resulting wave rundown crashed into the front of the landslide and partially crossed over the slide bulk, reaching the depressions behind the slide. On the east side of the basin, a portion of the water which was pushed forward by the landslide formed a wave with smaller amplitude that travelled to the east, reaching the eastern most end of the reservoir in the mountains. \r\n</p><p>During the whole event several impulse waves crested the dam or moved onto the surrounding slopes which became a way for the water to move out into the narrow canyon that connects the dam to the Piave Valley. The mass of water that poured into the canyon, compressing the air, generated a wave of pressure that acted as a wind. This &#34;wind&#34;, propagating at a speed greater than the waterfront, preceded the waterfront and produced the first damage in Longarone, before the water reached the town. The villages located along the Piave riverbed were completely devastated and turned into a flat plain of mud, with about 1700 casualties. The wave travelled upstream for about 5 km and in the downstream cross-sections of Ponte nelle Alpi and Belluno (located respectively at about 11 and 19 km from Longarone) the estimated maximum flow was 20% - 50% higher than the one observed during the famous 1966 flood wave. \r\n</p><p>The water depth of the wave in some points exceeded 50 m.  \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #10995:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1963, October 9.

Very strong underground shocks occurred in the regions of Friuli and Veneto at short time intervals between 20h and 20h30m; each of them lasted approximately 10sec and was accompanied by a loud underground rumble. Nothing but debris remained of the castle and an old extension of the church of S. Giovanni in Udine. The earthquake caused destruction in Cividale del Friuli, Madonna del Lanto, Faedis, Venzone, Tarcento, Tolmino and many other places. Rock falls occurred in the mountains near Gemona, and the River Livenza stopped flowing for a moment. Some old sources of water in the pleistoseistal area dried up, and new sources appeared. The earthquake was felt in Venice, Padua, Treviso, and in other places. The macroseismic epicentre was possibly located between Gemona (del Friuli) and Tolmino. 4-5 shocks more were felt at night, but they were weaker and shorter than the former.\r\n<p>Rollers appeared in the sea. They grew with such a roar that the citizens of Trieste, frightened by this phenomenon, were forced to leave their dwellings and to hide on the hill near the castle.

In addition to this, with reference to a source of the 16th century, data were given on the fact that during the earthquake in Venice the water went away far from the coast, and some fairly deep canals dried up. At the same time, the authors of the paper, on the basis of the absence of destruction and victims in Venice, believed that the estimate of the tsunami intensity should be reduced. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2130).\r\n</p><p>1511, March 26. 46<sup>o</sup>12&#39;N, 13<sup>o</sup>26&#39;E, earthquake magnitude 6.5, intensity IX, tsunami intensity 2, reliability 2.

The shock caused severe damage at Chittagong and other areas on the eastern seaboard of the Bay of Bengal. The Arakan coast was elevated for more than 160 km. The quake also caused a tsunami in the Bay of Bengal. The water in the Hoogly River in Kolkata rose by two meters.

Cummins referred to the 1762 earthquake which generated a tsunami and flooded the northern Bay of Bengal region.

The locality to the south of the main gates of the city of Shimabara were also covered with a layer from several tens of centimeters to 3 meters deep.<br />The collapse generated an enormous tsunami, more than 6-9 m in height in places, in Shimabara Bay. The height of the wave was estimated at 35-55 m at Shimabara. The length of coast, affected by the destruction of the tsunami, was 75 km. Homes and castles were washed out in the coastal cities, and fields were flooded at 17 villages. In all, 380 homes were washed away; <strong>9,745 people were killed</strong> or disappeared without a trace, and 707 people were injured as a result of the tsunami and the collapse; 496 head of cattle died. Three small islands situated near the coast disappeared. At the same time, the mud and sand washed out to sea formed a score of new small islands in the region of Minato port.<br />The tsunami also caused great destruction on the other shore of Shimabara Bay, in Kumamoto Prefecture. There were more than <strong>1,100 victims in Ashikita district, and 4,000 in the two adjacent districts of Uto and Tamana</strong>. There was also considerable destruction and <strong>343 residents drowned on the Amakusa Is</strong>.

At 2:49 P.M. local time as reported by the Governor to his superiors (Driver, 1993), a\r\ngreat earthquake occurred which lasted one and a half minutes and caused great damage. Aftershocks continued\r\nevery four to eight minutes until 11 o&#39;clock that night. They began again at 2:30 A.M. local time and continued for\r\nweeks. About 150 felt earthquakes were noted by March 11. The population was fearful that they were on a volcano\r\nand the island might explode or sink. Sand boils discharging sea water opened up cavities which had measured\r\ndepths of one to six yards. Twelve to seventeen of the cavities were in a line parallel to the river by Santa Cruz just south of Agana. The only reported loss of life was to Josefa Lujan, a woman caught by one of the three reported\r\ntsunami waves, near the Talofofo River. She was from Agana and going to Inarajan. She is the only reported fatality\r\ndue to a tsunami in Guam&#39;s history.

Magnitude 7.5, Guam Island. There was a destructive earthquake on the Mariana Islands. A tsunami occurred. [The tsunami was generated by an earthquake on the 24th or the 25th.] One of the eyewitnesses, who was on board a ship riding in the bay, gave the following account of the effects of the main earthquake and the tsunami in Umatac Bay: &#34;The first, main earthquake began with an exceptional trembling of the water, which was then transmitted to the land. The displacements of the ground were so large that all stone and brick buildings suffered to some extent, and many completely collapsed. One of my boats were taking on a supply of water in the mouth of the river. It was caught by the flood tide, and almost tossed on to the trees. Barrels and other objects were carried 1/2 km (1/4 mile) or more from the shore to open sea. When the wave rolled back, hundreds of fishes were left on the dried bottom. The shore near the river dropped about 3 1/2 m (12 feet). The wave entrained the ship with such force, that it could not hold to its anchors. The water ran up onto the island in an east-west direction. A mild northeasterly wind was blowing.&#34;\r\nIn the Inarajan region (southeast coast), a woman was caught up by the wave near the Talofofo River, and never reappeared. People arriving from Satawal Island (Caroline Islands) related that this island was flooded by a wave. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #79:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1849, January 24.

On Camiguin Island there was a\r\ndestructive earthquake, which devastated the extreme northern part of the island and which was felt on the islands of Mindanao, Bohoi, Cebu and others. Many wooden homes were destroyed and massive stone walls collapsed at Mambajao and Catarman; many avalanches occurred in the mountains. Many more shocks were registered almost daily until April 30. Four of these were strong, and were felt almost the same as the main earthquake (Maso, 1910 a).\r\n</p><p>On April 30, the Hibokhibok Volcano (Camiguin Island), which had been considered extinct, exploded and a new crater was formed at its foot. Maso (1911 b), describes the events as follows.\r\n</p><p>On April 30, at 7:00, a new volcano exploded with a terrifying roar on the north-northeast tip of the island. A column of steam, stones and ash rose into the air; the ash fell for a distance of up to 200 km from the volcano. Everything was destroyed in a radius of 2-3 km from the new crater. There were no victims, since the residents of the nearest settlement, Catarman, frightened by the earthquakes, had left their homes before the eruption. The underground shocks stopped almost completely for several days after the eruption.\r\n</p><p>Fuchs (1872) describes the eruption somewhat differently.\r\n</p><p>On April 30 (or May 1), the plain at Catarman settlement began to subside gradually, so that the roofs of the homes were soon at ground level. While many residents were observing this phenomenon, suddenly, at 17:00, a terrible roar pealed out, cracks appeared in the ground, and an eruption began from the small crater which had newly appeared in place of the village. A large cloud of smoke rose into the air. Flows of lava and water issued. The explosions, like shots from a large cannon, continued uninterrupted for several hours. Then a brief pause ensued, after which the explosions began again and new subsidences occurred, and lava again flowed from the crater, flooding the huts in its path and falling with a terrible hiss into the sea. A dense cloud of ash hung over the island. Shafts of flame from the volcano burst through the dark ash.

It was felt strongly by vessels offshore at Panama City, but no anomaly was observed at the tide gauge on Isla Naos (Pacific side). The cable between Colon and Jamaica broke, which suggests a submarine landslide that might have been caused by the earthquake. A 3m tsunami affected the San Blas Coast of Northern Panama; between 75 and 100 were drowned (reference #273).\r\n<p>1882, Sept. 7, about 3:00 [local time]. There was an earthquake at Panama, stronger than any previously known. Sieberg (1932), in giving the basic data on the earthquake, reports that it was accompanied by tsunami waves which were observed from Panama to Guayaquil [source of information unknown]. Iida (reference #79) surmises, without much evidence, that two earthquakes occurred: one in Panama and Nicaragua, the other in Colombia. [&#34;Tsunami wave in Guayaquil&#34; is an incorrect translation of &#34;Seismic wave down to Guayaquil&#34; in Sieberg, reference #1576, listed below] (reference #415)\r\n</p><p>1882, Sept. 7. Destruction in the city of Panama, several deaths. Also felt on the islands and a tsunami. Cable breaks. Damage suffered the landward towns, even Colon. Felt in Nicaragua to Greytown, North Colombia and Venezuela to Caracas. Seismic wave down to Guayaquil. Numerous, partly final aftershock to 1883. (ref #1576).\r\n</p><p>A large tsunami associated with the earthquake swept the San Blas Islands in northern Panama on 7 September 1882, killing about 65 people (Star and Herald, 1882; Nelson, 1889). A newspaper article that appeared in the Star and Herald (1882) of Panama City on 11 October 1882 contains a firsthand account of the tsunami damage. The article is based on details provided to the governor by one of the island inhabitants and contains the following statements:\r\n&#34;. . . the tide ran out a great distance, and on its return, swept away the villages built on the beaches of the different islands of the archipelago and on the mainland. The outflow and inflow occurred four times a day, the greatest damage being done by the third wave. The villages of Rio Coco, Isla Paloma, Napacandi, on the islands of the same name, were swept away, and more than forty persons were drowned. At Playon Grande, every house was washed down,\r\nbut only two persons were drowned. Playon Chico, which adjoins it, also suffered. All the produce stored at Rio Mono was swept away, but no lives were lost. The chief loss of produce, however, has taken place at Aguili Candi island\r\n. . . Sixteen persons lost their lives there, and several thousand dollars worth of imported goods were swept into the sea. The villages of Rio Banana and Mosquito have also been flooded, the people left homeless, and their goods destroyed. &#34;Although the sea was observed to be relatively calm at Colon, the Canal Company tidal gauge located offshore registered a distinct tsunami with a maximum height of 62 cm (Bulletin du Canal Interoceanique, 1882; Nelson, 1889). At Miguel de la Borda, the tide rose and flooded beach houses (Star and Herald, 1882). Because subsidence was extensive in the area, however, the tsunami effects at Miguel de la Borda cannot be accurately estimated. The submarine telegraph cable between Col6n and Jamaica broke during the earthquake (Star and Herald, 1882; De Montessus de Ballore, 1888; Nelson, 1889). (reference #1575)</p>",

At Gerace, the earthquake of 1784 was regarded as stronger than the great earthquake of 1783 Mar. 27. \r\n<p>The earthquake of 1907 occurred during an epoch of comparative calm in the whole of Calabria.

        "comments": "1922, November 10, 23:53 [local time]. There was a very strong earthquake in the southern part of Atacama province, with a zone of destruction approximately from Copiapo to Coquimbo. The instrumental and macroseismic epicenters were fixed at sea in the region of Vallenar - Huasco. This tsunami generating earthquake began with relatively weak, but comparatively rapidly intensifying oscillations, lasting from 1/2 to 8 minutes according to different estimates. The earthquake was preceded by strong foreschocks, felt on the 3rd and 7th of November. Seismic activity in the focal zone of the earthquake was high for two months.\r\n<p>At Chanaral, the tsunami began an hour after the earthquake and lasted about 4 hours. The sea surged onshore three times. It rose 9 m above the high tide mark, destroyed 14 homes, and carried four homes inland (there was no destruction resulting directly from the earthquake here). The tides were calm, but prolonged.\r\n</p><p>At Caldera the sea at first remained completely calm after the earthquake, but then it rose: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or 45 minutes after the earthquake, according to different estimates. The most reliable in this respect, is the report of a witness, who at the time of the earthquake was on a ship riding in the harbor, and who set off for the port in a boat immediately after the strong shocks had ceased. When the boat arrived at shore 15 minutes later, the water had risen about 5 m above the high tide level and almost splashed over the moorage.\r\n</p><p>At Coquimbo, the sea was absolutely quiet before the earthquake. About 2 hours after the earthquake, a tsunami appeared. The waves spread from the northeast to the southwest along the axis of the bay, passed along the western and eastern shores, but did not cause any damage. On the south shore, the water rose to a considerable height. Three large tidal waves were observed, the third being the most destructive. The water penetrated 2 km at the most low-lying places, and the rise was 5 m above the maximum high tide line or 6 m above the mean sea level. It reached 7 m above mean sea level at the railway quay. The water rose and fell slowly; the ebb was smaller than the flood; the surface of the water was calm. As a result, the part of the city situated at the southern apex of the Bay was totally destroyed, not alone by the water, but also by boats and other objects which it carried.\r\n</p><p><b>Several hundred people drowned in the waves.</b>\r\n</p><p>The tsunami was also observed at Huasco, Antofasgasta, Callao, San Felix and San Ambrosio Islands. The tsunami arrived at San Diego, CA, 13 hours after the earthquake and at San Francisco, CA, 13.8 hours after the earthquake. The tsunami arrived at Hilo, HI, in 14.5 hours. The tsunami arrived at Apia (Samoa Islands) in 14.1 hours. At Pago Pago on Tutuila Island the period of oscillations was 20 minutes. The tsunami was also observed in Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia, and the Philippines.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)</p>",

        "comments": "1929, Nov 18, 5:30 pm local time. The earthquake occurred approximately 250 km south of Newfoundland along the southern edge of the Grand Banks. The earthquake triggered a large submarine slump (an estimated volume of 200 cubic km of material was moved on the Laurentian slope) which ruptured 12 transatlantic cables in multiple places, and generated a tsunami... More than 40 local villages in southern Newfoundland were affected, where numerous homes, ships, businesses, livestock and fishing gear were destroyed. Also lost were more than 280,000 pounds of salt cod. Total property losses were estimated at more than $1 million 1929 dollars. (reference #1827)\r\n<p>A tsunami struck the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland Nov 18, 1929 after the 1702 NST magnitude 7.2 earthquake occurred in the Laurentian Slope Seismic Zone. This event is Canada&#39;s most tragic earthquake with twenty-eight lives lost. The tsunami swept into the coast of Newfoundland 2.5 hours after the seismic event near the top of a high spring tide. Water levels first fell far below normal then, in three successive waves, that often arrived on shore as breaking waves, water levels rose 2 to 7 m... St. Lawrence at the head of Great St. Lawrence Harbour was one of the communities inundated, fortunately with no loss of life, but with substantial property damage... The map [St. Lawrence] indicates a tsunami height of about 4 m, a runup height of about 13 m and a runup distance of at least 760 m at the head of the harbour... The earthquake shook loose a portion of the continental slope over a 20,000 km2 area and the resulting turbidity current flowed at 70 km/hr to redistribute 200 km3 of material over a 150,000 km2 area on the Sohm Abyssal Plain\u0085 The tsunami created by the Nov 18, 1929 slump on the Laurentian Continental Slope took about 2 hours to reach Bermuda at an average speed of just over 700 km/hr. It took about 2.5 hours to reach the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland and about 3 hours to reach Cape Breton Island at an average speed of about 144 km/hr... In the case of the 1929 tsunami as it arrived on the Burin Peninsula, in all cases witnesses report it was first seen at about 1930 NST as a major withdrawal (NST is 0.5 hr ahead of AST used in the rest of Atlantic Canada). In the communities of Lamaline, Taylor&#39;s Bay, Lord&#39;s Cove and Port au Bras there are reports of a breaking wave arriving; up to three main pulses were seen. Many smaller pulses of the tsunami continued to affect the area for several hours after the main event. In Burin Harbour, which is quite deep, the tsunami tended to be seen as a very rapidly rising sealevel over about a 5 to 10 minute period, then the sealevel rapidly fell over the same period... The tsunami with its three successive pulses arrived during a high astronomic tide. To make matters worse, the three main pulses arrived over about a half-hour period near the top of a rising (extra high) &#39;spring tide&#39; or during &#34;the springes&#34;. Fortunately it was a bright moonlit and a windless evening; the sea was dead calm, thus there were no storm waves to do extra damage. In addition, the tsunami&#39;s arrival in early evening meant people were up and about and awake to save themselves... Most estimates of the day suggested that the 1929 tsunami elevation was 30 to 50 ft high (9.1 to 15.2 m). In fact, it is doubtful that the tsunami elevation reached more than about 7.5 m above the normal calm sea... (ref #1719)\r\n</p><p>The 1929 Newfoundland tsunami the tsunami wave heights were 3 m in St. Lawrence Bay and 7 m in Taylor&#39;s Bay, but the runup heights at the heads of the bays were about 13 m.

After several hours the harbor was drained, leaving only numerous pools with stranded fish in them. The vessel &#34;Veronica&#34;, which had recently been launched, ran aground. Other sources reported that a strong ebb had been followed by a moderate flow which had failed to cover the entire bottom of the bay. To some observers on vessels lying at anchor 5.5 km from Napier, it seemed as if the city first lifted and then sank after the quake began. The water around the vessels became turbid. </p><p>(Questionable tsunami).\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #11746:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>The 1931 February 02 MS7.8 MW7.4-7.6 Hawke&#39;s Bay earthquake, one of the largest earthquakes in New Zealand&#39;s short historical record and responsible for causing extensive deformation (uplift and subsidence) of the Hawke Bay coastline and several large coastal landslides, caused a relatively small tsunami, except at Waikare Estuary, where a large landslide caused a 15&#43; m surge destroying a farm shed (de Lange &amp; Healy, 1986). No significant tsunami was noticeable along the ocean coast near Napier, nor at the Port of Napier, attributed to the outpouring of water from the Ahuriri Lagoon (Callaghan, 1933; Marshall, 1933). Marshall reported that water in the Ahuriri Lagoon (location not given) rose 0.6-0.3 m above normal tide level. However, this may be attributable to differential uplift across the Lagoon, and/or seiching. De Lange &amp; Healy (1986) also found no compelling evidence of a tsunami along the Napier foreshore, despite Laing&#39;s (1954) report a large wave along Marine Parade and a surge in the inner harbour/Ahururi Lagoon entrance. Considering Callaghan (1933) and Marshall (1933), Laing&#39;s report must be considered erroneous. Marshall&#39;s (1933) report on the coastline from Clifton on the southern shore of Hawke Bay to east of Mohaka, which was examined for evidence of uplift as well as earthquake shaking and tsunami effects, notes very little evidence of tsunami, certainly he mentions no evidence of a large tsunami. The ridges and furrows on the gravel beaches caused by strong shaking were not noted to have been disturbed by waves. Although Marshall (1933) considered at least two of the three large landslides he described from Old Man&#39;s Bluff to the Mohaka River capable of causing a localised tsunami, he gives is no indication that any specifically related to the landslides was observed. Other reports indicate a 3 m surge at Wairoa (de Lange &amp; Healy, 1986), a series of surges and recessions (1-2 m?) at Waikokopu (de Lange &amp; Healy, 1986; Marshall, 1933) and several surges at Clifton (1-2 m?) (Parsons, pers. comm.). De Lange &amp; Healy (1986) discuss Hart&#39;s (1931) evidence that a tsunami was recorded in Sydney, concluding that &#34;Hart&#39;s records must be considered unreliable&#34;. <b>A validity of 4 </b>is assigned to the tsunami, for which the generating mechanisms were deformation and/or coastal landslide, and possibly submarine slumping, although none is specifically mentioned.</p>",

However, it becomes no clear whether it was a permanent sea level change or the sea returned to its initial position.\r\n</p><p>However, in Kos it is still a common belief among the local population and the mass media that a tsunami of 2-3 m in height affected the coastal zone of Kos city after this earthquake (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch ?v&#61;K7ichtKDzcQ).

However, in the same publication another eyewitness said that &#34;...the sea was cut through by a strong wind causing huge sea waves running like crazy horses with whirlwind speed...waves ready to attack the land swallowing up everything there.&#34; However,it is not clear whether the sea was already rough when the earthquake happened or became rough some time later. This point is better clarified in the account of the eyewitness Kasdaglis (1998) who clearly recollected that after the earthquake his family decided to stay outdoors and while was looking for a safe place to settle they observed that &#34;the sea was gloomy, sibylline but not threatening.&#34; The same author added that during the evening the calm sea turned to rough. Having in mind that during the same evening heavy rain hit Kos (Manousis 1934; Kasdaglis 1998; various press reports) we concluded that: (1)in the morning of April 23, 1933, when the earthquake struck, the weather was calm, (2)bad weather conditions with strong winds, heavy rain and rough sea prevailed later by the end of the day and during the evening. Combining (1) and (2) we adopted that the <b>sea waves observed very likely were due to strong wind rather than to tsunami triggered by the earthquake.</b></p>",

The number of homes destroyed directly by the earthquake was 2,598; 1,443 people died. In addition, 1,451 homes were washed away by the ensuing tsunami waves.</p><p>A sizeable tsunami rolled onto the coast of the Kii Peninsula and Shikoku Island. The tsunami was strongest on the east coast of Kii Strait, from Fukuro to Mio, where the rise of water was 6 m. The rise was slightly less on the western coast of the strait, and increased from south to north (from 2-3 to 4.5-5 m). In Tosa Bay, the maximal rise\r\nof water was observed in the Susaki region, where it also reached 5 m, but the impact of the tsunami was considerably weaker here than in the Kii Strait.</p><p>According to visual observations, the first wave was the highest at Sinjo and Kanno&#39;ura, while the second wave was the highest at most other points, and the third was highest far into Susaki Gulf. The records for the tide gauges situated on the eastern shore of the Kii Strait, showed that the tsunami began here with an ebb, which was followed by a large rise in the water level.</p><p>The following is known about the effects of the tsunami at individual points. On both shores of the entrance to Yura Bay (at Katakui, Okui, Kashiwa and west of Kamiya), the rise of water was 2.7-2.8 m. According to residents, the tsunami advanced slowly here, and the water rose gradually; at Katakui, the sea bottom was exposed. East of the Kashiwa-Itoya line, the rise of water increased markedly, reaching 3.9 m at Yura and Fukui, and 4-4.2 m at the head of the bay.</p><p>At Tokushima, the water rose only 1.5 m and the incursion did no damage. The rise of water increased towards the head of Akaishi Bay, which constricts in a southwestern direction. At Komatsushima, it was only 1.7-1.9 m (possibly due to the protection of the breakwater) and at Yokosu, the water did not cross a dike 2 m high, but between Kanaiso and Akaishi, it even flowed across a dike 3 m high. At Akaishi, the water rose 2.8-2.9 m. The tsunami approached Akaishi in the form of a step, and the run-up was rather strong. No little damage was done: dikes were destroyed, homes were flooded, and different objects were carried away.</p><p>At Shishikui, partly screened from the south by a rocky cape, the rise of water on shore was 3.3 m. Protective tree stands, planted along the coast, somewhat weakened the thrust of the water, and for the most part it overflowed along the mouth of the Shishikui River. The broken surf rose up river. On the south side of this cape, the rise of water was 4.4 m. At Kanno&#39;ura, situated somewhat to the west, the rise of water was rather high, but the coast did not suffer, except for the top of a little bay which constricts to the north. The ships in the harbor did not run aground which indicates the low speed of currents at the steep and deep shore.</p><p>At Kanno&#39;ura and at Cape Muroto, according to accounts, the movement of the water began with an ebb tide. Muroto Port dried up as far as the breakwater. At Cape Muroto, both the rise of water and the wave periods were less than on other sections of the coast. At Kochi, a large area of the subsided shore was flooded with water, but the tsunami itself was very weak. The tsunami practically did not enter Urado Bay which has a narrow, long and very shallow entrance.</p><p>The tsunami was registered far from the source, on the coast of the Hawaiian Islands and North and South America.</p><p><i>See individual runup locations for more information.</i>.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #150:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>Lists 1,362 deaths, 11,661 houses destroyed, 1,451 houses washed away, 2,598 houses burned down.\r\n</p><p>View a calculated <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu_travel_time.shtml#Honshu1946\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tsunami-travel-time map</a>.</p>",

(reference #12761)</p><p>Some unusual events occurred during the earthquake. In Cesme, 5 km away in the direction of Cape Yildiz, grey coloured water gushed out of the sea, the height of the jet being up to 15m (Aksam, 25 July 1949; Hurriyet, 25 July 1949; Son Posta, 25 July 1949; Vatan 25 July 1949). The flow of the water network increased for the next 3-4 h. The sea between Chios and Cesme turned red in colour and became turbid for a few hours. Hot natural springs disappeared in Karaburun, re-emerging later in different locations. The sea attacked the coasts of Cesme town, leaving many dead fish behind after it subsided. Fishermen are reported to have described flames spurting out of the sea surface (Cumhuriyet, 24 July 1949). In Chios the runup was about 2m high and the sea waves flooded the beach (Papazachos and Papazachou, 1997). (reference #4676)</p>",

It reached the nearest coasts of the islands of Shikoku and Kyusllu approximately 20 minutes after the earthquake. On the average, the range of the oscillations in sea level on these coasts was 2-2.5 m. The greatest rise of water, 3 m\r\nor somewhat more, was resgistered on Shikoku Island at \r\nUrashiri and Komame; here the water flooded across the protective dikes and caused destruction. At most points, however, the oscillations in level did not exceed the regular flood and ebb oscillations. The tsunami, on the basis of visual observations, began with a flood tide almost everywhere. The first or the second wave was the highest. As a rule, the water level rose quietly, and strong currents arose only in narrow straits. The mean period of oscillations was close to 20 minutes.\r\n</p><p>The tsunami was registered clearly by the tide gauges on the southern coast of Japan. The tsunami begins with a flood tide on all the tide gauge records. However, on the records of the instruments set up on Shikoku Island, the height of the first trough is approximately twice as great as the height of the first crest. For this reason, it has been surmised that there were subsidences of the floor in the southern part of the source of the tsunami, while elevations of the floor predominated on the whole at the source. According to Hatori, the vertical displacements of the sea bottom at the source of the tsunami were about 20 cm, and the energy of the tsunami was 1.3 X 10<sup>20</sup> ergs. According to Aida, a comparatively uniform elevation of the bottom by 30-35 cm took place at the source, and the energy of the tsunami was (1.4-2.2) X 10<sup>19</sup> ergs. It is conjectured that the earthquake was a consequence of gently sloping overthrust in a west to east direction. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #45:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>A 2.3 meter tsunami was generated on the east of Kyushu.

The nearest towns, about 70 km away from the epicenter, are rural municipalities of the provinces of N. and E. Samar.<p>Recent investigations done in 2009 disclosed eyewitnesses from the E. Samar towns of Can-avid, San Policarpo and Taft for this particular earthquake. In San Policarpo, which is about 50 km from epicenter, the tsunami was observed after strong shaking by two individuals who were 11 and 13 years old at that time. The eyewitnesses were Mr. Cesar Moratal and Ms. Fe Moratal who are from Bgy Binogawan. They mentioned that it was high tide at that time and after the shaking they noticed that the sea receded by as much as 50 m and then went back slowly and flooded the shore by as much as 60 m inland. </p><p>In Can-avid which is about 68 km from the epicenter, the tsunami was observed by Mr Zosimo Miso who was 11 years old when the earthquake happened. He was in their barangay (Bgy Rawis) when, after the shaking, he saw waves about 2.5 m high which inundated as far as 120 m inland. </p><p>Other eyewitnesses interviewed were from the town of Taft, which is about 78 km from the epicenter. The Taft eyewitnesses interviewed by Joan Salcedo, Vilma Hernandez and Nolan Evangelista in 2009 were Ms Ana Apable who was 34 years old when the tsunami occurred, Mayor Francisco Adalim who was 19 years old and municipal planning officer Roberto Hilario who was 8 years old when the tsunami occurred. Ms Apable stated that while on a banca on Taft River, she felt a strong water oscillation and observed strong water current. Then she observed rise in water level which lowered immediately. Later, fish were found on the canals inland. Meanwhile, Mayor Adalim observed people running in panic during the earthquake, then almost knee-high sea water entered the plaza area. Mr Hilario noted that height was greater than 1.5 m and that there were 3 waves. </p><p>Hatori (1994) also gave a tsunami magnitude of 2 for this event and attributed one death to this earthquake although none of the above accounts mentioned any death.</p><p>Tsunami probability ranking is &#34;positive&#34;.

One hundred fatalities were due to the tsunami, four from the earthquake in Japan. There was extensive damage to ships, roads and houses amounting to about 800 million dollars. (reference #1315)\r\n<p>The earthquake generated a tsunami that began striking the Japan coast approximately 12 minutes after the earthquake occurred. One hundred lives were lost as a consequence of the tsunami alone. The tsunami also caused significant flooding and property damage to coastal\r\nregions. The tsunami affected the entire Japan Sea, hitting the surrounding coastline of the Korean Peninsula and the USSR. Three lives were lost in South Korea, when the wave arrived there approximately 1-1/2 hours after the earthquake... Clearly, most of the impact occurred north\r\nof the Oga Peninsula, where a maximum run-up of 14.9 m was recorded... Significant wave run-up was also observed along the Korean coast... A maximum run-up of 3.2 m was followed by a run-down of -5.6 m [Port of Imweon]. Most of the impact of the tsunami in South Korea occurred between Imweon and Sogcho.. During the tsunami, 100 individuals were drowned, most of them at Noshiro, Hachimori, and the Oga Peninsula. These individuals were caught on the shoreline or on offshore construction sites. Tsunami\r\nwarnings were issued approximately 14 minutes after the earthquake occurred; however, the leading wave reached the shoreline at these locations at approximately the same time.\r\nIn Korea, three deaths were attributed to the tsunami. Since the tsunami reached the Korean shoreline approximately 1-1/2 hours after the earthquake occurred, these deaths could have been prevented... In Korea, over 70 ships were damaged by the tsunami... Many coastal flood protective structures were severely damaged during\r\nthe tsunami. For example, concrete armor units weighing 4 metric tons were moved hundreds of feet inland near the area of maximum run-up. In addition, many levees and seawalls were overtopped and damaged. These protective structures were designed for storm waves and were unable to accommodate the waves produced by the tsunami. (reference #149)</p>",

        "comments": "2001, June 23. The tsunami struck the Peruvian coast and was observed on tide gages across the Pacific Ocean. In Peru, damage from the tsunami was limited to the south-central portion of coastline from the town of Atico in the north to Matarani in the south. The area surrounding the city of Camana was hit hardest by the waves. Camana is a popular summer resort of around 53,000, 560 miles south of Lima. Here, maximum runup measurements exceeded 7 meters in some locations, with greater than 1-km inundation in some places. According to reports, 2,000 hectares of agricultural land were inundated in Camana. The tsunami swept over the town, and its surrounding rice and sugarcane fields. About 26 people are known to have perished as a result of the tsunami, with roughly 70 missing. The death toll would have been higher had the event not occurred during the Southern Hemisphere winter when the beaches are nearly empty. (reference #1315)\r\n<p>2001, June 23. Demographic information on earthquake\r\nvictims compiled by the Instituto Nacional de Defensa Civil suggests that most of the victims of ground-shaking damage were the young or the elderly. However, about a third of the tsunami victims were between 30 and 50. No demographic\r\ninformation was available for the 52 persons listed as missing, but anecdotal evidence gathered by the\r\nreconnaissance team indicated that most were farmers working in the onion fields. The normal Saturday work shift ended at 4:00 pm, and before their shift ended. (reference #1373)\r\n</p><p>At most sites estimates of both inundation\r\nand runup were obtained. The highest runup measured\r\n(8.8 m) was on the narrow beach at Playa Chira, where the coastal platform narrows to less than 500 meters and eyewitnesses described splashing of the waves against the cliffs. (reference #4279)\r\n</p><p>As a coseismic effect, a local tsunami was generated, which after 15 min, caused the flood and destruction of the beach resorts of Camana and resulted in the death of 25 people and 62 missing persons. (reference #12809)\r\n</p><p>While, in the most populated beaches such as El Chorro, La Punta and Las Cuevas, it caused the total destruction of 3,500 buildings of noble material and moderate damage in another 1000 approximately, the same ones that in greater numbers were used in the summer periods. As a result of the tsunami, 23 people died in the town of Camana and another 64 were reported missing. The economic losses in this town have been considerable since its entire population subsists on agriculture and commerce. (reference #12813)</p>",

An earthquake which affected all of Taiwan Island and caused great destruction, was accompanied by tsunami waves, which ran onto the coast of the island in an east-west direction. Almost the entire island was flooded for a distance of more than 120 km (30 leagues). The tremors and tsunami waves lasted 8 hours. The three main cities of the island and 20 villages were first destroyed by the earthquake and then by the tsunami. Retreating, the water left buildings, at best, as piles of debris. Not a single living soul was left. More than 40,000 residents died.  Many ships were smashed or sunk. In place of the capes, jutting into the sea, which were washed out, fresh scarps and gulfs filled with water were formed. Zelandia Fort (Anpin) and Pingkchingi Fort were washed away together with the hills on which they stood. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #150:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1782, May 22.

From the official dynastic record (National Palace Museum 1982), there was a storm at Taiwan on 2 June 1782. The storm was reported to have induced some damage, but the crop yield of the whole province (including Fujian &amp; Taiwan) was reported to be not affected. Thus, a great disaster occurring in the region during that period was highly unlikely. The casualty claimed (40,000 lives) was approximately 5% of the whole contemporary population of Taiwan, which could have seriously damaged the stability and economy of the society. This event is invalidated due to its unreasonably long period. Even if it is assumed validated, it still could not pass the confirmation.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #12391:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>Around 4th to 5th month, 46th Qianlong year (1781), weather was fine.

There was a powerful tremor on Umboi Island (Rooke), in the passage between New Guinea and New Britain. A few seconds later, a second, stronger shock knocked down a stove. This was followed by more shocks, but of lesser force. In the morning it was found that large landslides had occurred; cracks 1 m wide had formed in the ground and extended from Nurua village to the sea shore. West of Tolociwa Island (Lotten), a volcano supposedly rose from the water and smoked for a long time. After the tremor, the sea &#34;began to move&#34;. \r\n</p><p>Between 1856 and 1858 in the Miklucho-Maklay coast in Astrolabe Bay. According to local residents, the village of Aralu, situated between the mouths of the Kabenau and Koli Rivers, was destroyed by an earthquake and a subsequent tidal wave. Since this happened at night, only a few men and two women could be saved. They founded a new village, and called it Gambu. A tsunami was observed in Irian Bay. \r\n<br />(Evidently this is the same event as the preceding description.)\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #79:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1856. Dampier Strait, New Guinea. Aralu village overwhelmed. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #99:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1856. Maclay coast, New Guinea. Remarks by de Miklouho-\r\nMaclay, 1884 (ref #12433). Talking about earthquakes, the natives informed me, that on a former occasion, before my arrival on the coast in 1871, a village named Aralu (situated on the coast between the rivers, Kabeneu and Koli) had been completely swept away by the waves after an earthquake. All the huts and the coconut trees surrounding them, were broken down and carried away by the tidal waves, and the inhabitants, men, women and children were drowned (it occurred during the night). A few men belonging to the village and who happened to be away at the time on a visit to some neighbouring village would not attempt to rebuild their huts on the old place, but went to live at Gumbu now Yeimas, also a coastal village but which had escaped destruction being built further inland. The destruction of Aralu was remembered by not very old people and it took place I suppose about the year 1856. The natives on the Maclay-Coast complained about the sickness in the villages on the coast which happened soon after the destruction of Aralu. The sickness amongst them, I believe, was the result of decomposition of animal and vegetable matter left behind on shore after the inundation produced by the high tidal wave, as has been observed, on some islands of the Pacific.</p>",

The tsunami apparently took the lives of at least seven villagers in the town of Petit Paradis, on Haiti&#39;s western coast... For the first time, residents of this coastal village are telling the story of a localized tsunami that hit here immediately after the 7.0 earthquake. The relatively small tsunami reached a few hundred yards into the village, which was devastated by the quake. Steeve Badio is a fisherman here. His house was destroyed, as were the small canoes carved from wood he used to earn a living. &#34;The sea went back,&#34; he explained in Creole. &#34;It sounded like a helicopter ... and then the waves came up,&#34; he said. Badio says the water was higher than the trees, and when it returned back to the ocean, Badio&#39;s father was gone and so were his two nephews: 4-year-old Wolga and 2-year-old James. Badio says they haven&#39;t been able to have a funeral without their bodies.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #1053:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>The waves, which averaged about ten feet (three meters) high, slammed shores along the Bay of Port-au-Prince and the southern coast of the island of Hispaniola (see map), which is shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

The Istanbul-based Kandilli earthquake research center said the small &#34;tsunami&#34; pushed sea water up 100 meters (yards) inland.

(reference #11850)\r\n</p><p>The quake is also believed to have caused a small tsunami in the port of Kos which subsequently suffered extensive damage. The tidal wave was described as being about 70 cm high. (reference #11851)\r\n</p><p>According to findings in field surveys and eyewitness reports, there was almost no significant water motion at the western face of Bodrum peninsula. The tsunami effects were observed at the south coast of Bodrum peninsula only from geographic latitude 27.255E to 27.528E as well as in the northeast coast of Kos Island. The maximum run-up of about 1.9 m was observed at the mouth of a small dry stream (27.407924E, 37.029879N) at Gumbet Bay, which is the most hit area by the tsunami at Bodrum Peninsula. There is an interesting observation that no damage happened in the next bay (Bitez bay at West and Bodrum marina at East of Gumbet bay) which indicates that main impacts of tsunami localized in Gumbet bay. According to the analysis of the records of a security camera at easternmost end of Gumbet bay, sea receded 5 minutes after the earthquake and advanced up to 60m inundation at 13th minute. The run-up traces were found at 2 m elevation (not the inundation border) at Karaada-Black Island (27.461422E, 36.966323N) Kucuk Poyraz bay which is facing the tsunami source area at the epicenter. The tsunami has also been observed at Akyaka village at the eastern end of Gokova bay 80 km away from the epicenter. In Kos, the maximum amplitude of ~1.5 m was observed in the old port of the town, as it comes out from eyewitness accounts, tsunami traces left behind and the analysis of security camera video. In the coast outside the Kos port the tsunami heights did not exceed ~1.0 m. This event occurred in a small area and showed unexpected run-up distribution in the near field area which indicates that the tsunami triggering mechanism is not homogeneous. The event also reminded that the tsunami potential in the eastern Mediterranean is considerable. (reference #11858)</p>",

A huge rockfall [38 deg 12 min N, 22 deg 12 min E] that came down from the southern coast of the strait without any earthquake caused <b>three waves 3 - 6 m</b> [tsunami intensity 4] high which devastated the southern shore of the gulf from Aiyion to Psathopyrgos and the northern shore from Monastiraki to Doubia. The blows of the first wave were preceded by a rumble. Fishing boats were smashed against coastal rocks along the segment of the southern shore from Selianitika to Lambiri, i.e. at a distance of 3 km on both sides of the estuary of the River Erineos; fish, barrels, pots and pans, and other objects were scattered about in the fields; small flimsily-constructed houses were destroyed; the same\r\noccurred on the segment of the northern shore from Marathias to Trizonia. <b>Two people were drowned and 12 were injured</b>. The waves were especially fierce on Cape Salmenikos near the western coast of the River Erineos. Here, the coastal strip over an area of 55,000 m<sup>2</sup> was submerged between 5 and 44 m. The volume of the landslide was 57,000m<sup>3</sup>. Another landslide (26,000 m<sup>3</sup>) occurred within the river bed. The water flooded the dry land on its western bank over an area of approximately 500 m. Fruit trees were torn out with their\r\nroots, vineyards were ruined on both banks of the river over an area of 150,000 m<sup>2</sup>. The predominant period of the waves was 2 min.

A subterranean rumble was heard the first 3 to 6 m high wave struck, but no shock was felt. From Selianitika to Labiri, each about 3 km distant from the mouth of the Erineos river, fishing boats were crashed on the rocks, fish were found strewn on fields, small houses of very poor construction were destroyed, and barrels, bedsteads and kitchen utensils littered the shoreline. The same occurred on the northern coast of the gulf from Marathia to Trizonia. Two people were drowned and 12 were injured. The waves were particularly severe on the Cape Salmenikos, on the western side of the river, where a coastal strip of about 55,000 square metres slumped 5 to 44 m under the sea. Slump mass: 57,000 cubic meters. Another slump took place in the bed of the river (26,000 cubic meters). On the western side of the river the water entered about 500 m inland.

        "comments": "A tidal wave occurred on the north and east coasts of Graham I. at about 02:30 on Tuesday (LT), Mar 28, 1963. The wave coincided with an unusually high tide. In Prince Rupert a high tide of 7.5 m occurred at 03:18 (LT). This was 0.52 m above the predicted tide, and only 0.34 m below the all time recorded extreme high tide.<p>At Wiah Point the wave, or waves, washed over a high water rock, and dislodged two big oil tanks which has been erected there about 30 cm above high water, and washed them onto the shore. The tidal wave that hit the remote west coast of the Queen Charlotte I., got 10.7 m, tore oil tanks from concrete bases and apparently took the life of a man. The tidal wave caused extensive damage at Weah Point near the village of Masset.</p><p>About 3.2 km north of Masset a number of logs were washed onto the road, which is there about 1.2 m above high water. At Tow Hill logs were moved that had been in the same position on the beach for a number of years. At the mouth of the Tlell River, where a tidal bore has been observed on occasion, noise as of a wave travelling up the river was heard during the night, and a small piece of arable land near the high water line was flooded and damaged.</p><p>No record of the tsunami wave is seen on the tide gauge records in Prince Rupert or in Tusu, on the west coast of the Queen Charlotte I. A check for a filed death certificate at the Dept. of Vital Statistics in Victoria reveals a man was indeed lost in the sea in the period March 28-30, 1963 but reported missing near Jedway, BC which is on the inside southern tip of Moresby I. just north of Cape St. James.</p><p>An interview with Mr. Edward Hartt of the Canadian Coast Guard at Seal Cove near Prince Rupert confirmed the early morning arrival of this approximately 5.5 m high wave (over the tide) at Langara Lighthouse where he was the lightkeeper at the time. The wave broke two large fuel tanks from their moorings at the lighthouse dock and deposited them ashore well above high water. Mr. Hartt felt the source of this large wave was probably from the southwest because of the areas where most the damage occurred around the lighthouse.</p><p>A disturbance was reported from Dixon Entrance region of the Queen Charlotte I. during the night of March 30-31. The wave heights reached from 3.7 to 5.5 m above high water and caused minor damage at Langara I., Wiah Point, and Port Simpson. The disturbance was not recorded by any tide gauge and was not reported from any other area. No correlation between this event and any seismic or atmospheric disturbance has been found.</p><p>The date reported by von Hake and Cloud [1965] is different to that reported in the Canadian newspapers but likely represents the same event. The report of minor damage at Port Simpson by VonHake and Cloud was not confirmed in the interviews of Port Simpson residents by the author. It is unfortunate that the lightkeepers records from other lighthouses nearer to Port Simpson during this period (March 1963) are no longer available to confirm any closer sightings of this unusual wave to Port Simpson. According to Mr. Ed. Hartt these records were destroyed when the coast Guard moved their offices from Prince Rupert to Seal Cove in 1972...</p><p>Stephenson [2003] resumes the information on this event as follows:<br />-If there was a tsunami, it was a local event generated by an underwater slump.<br />-This tsunami event was almost certainly smaller than any of the &#34;reported&#34; heights. From the report by Willie Rapatz it follows that the dislodged tanks were only about 0.3 m above the high water (HW) line, and the road which logs washed up onto was only about 1.2 m above the HW line.<br />-The reported 10 and 12 m waves were probably heights above chart datum, meaning that the maximum wave height was about 5.5 m.</p><p>(above from reference #4153)</p><p>1963, March 30/31. In British Columbia, at Wiah Point (Langara I.) and Port Simpson, the water rose. There was no earthquake; a doubtful tsunami (Reference #415).</p>",

This eruption of Saint Augustine Volcano, producing a reported ashfall of up to 5 inches, was accompanied by a series of tsunamis.  The first wave may have been produced by the effect of the air wave from the eruption on the water, while the tsunami was the result of a debris avalanche from the collapse of the north face of the peak. An eyewitness account of the volcanic tsunami produced by the eruption was recorded in the daily log of the Alaska Commercial Company trading post at English Bay(Alaska Commercial Company, 1883): &#34;At this morning at 8:15 o&#39;dock, 4 tidal waves flowed with a westerly current, one following the other at the rate of 30 miles p. hour into the shore, the sea rising 20 feet aboye the usual level.&#34; Augustine Island, a nearly circular volcanic island that has had six significant eruptions in historical times, is surrounded by underwater deposits similar to that produced by this slide; tsunamis were probably generated repeatedly by this volcano in prehistorical times.

Tis same event had a regional impact on all the coast of Campania; in particular it largely wiped away the port structures of Naples and Amalfi that are directly exposed to waves generated in the Aeolian region. Although the letter by Petrarch and the devastation of Amalfi have been interpreted in various ways (a tsunami caused by submarine eruption or by an off shore earthquake or by a landslide on Mt. Epomeo at Ischia&#39;s island), with some of them being unlikely (extraordinary storm, mudflows), these include the possibility that a tsunami struck the Campania coasts on 24th November 1343.

        "comments": "1979, July 18. A strong tsunami occurred in Indonesia. According to the preliminary data, a tsunami with a height of 7-9 m was observed on Lomblen island (8<sup>o</sup> S., Lat, 123<sup>o</sup> 30&#39; W. Long). In four villages <b>539 people lost their lives and 700 were declared missing</b>. Water covered the land to a distance of 1,500 m. The possible reasons for the generation of the tsunami were the eruption of a volcano, a landslide, or the falling of part of the mountain peak, into the sea. An earthquake is ruled out. At first it was erroneously thought that the tsunami was generated by a volcanic eruption. This misperception was due to an incorrect translation from the Indonesian language.\r\n<p>It was later concluded that the cause of the tsunami was a landslide on one of the capes on the southern coast of Lomblen Island. The settlements of Waiteba, located at the neck of the cape on the eastern side of the cape, and Labala-Mulang on the western side suffered the most. The tsunami started with the sea receding from the coast and then returned with tremendous force. Mainly villagers rather than fishermen suffered. </p><p>(above from reference 417)\r\n</p><p>1979, July 18. Sources from the daily newspapers &#34;Kompas&#34; and &#34;Suara Karya&#34; of Indonesia stated that the tsunami waves that occurred on July 18, 1979 at approximately 1:00 A.M. (local time) in Indonesia swept up the coastal area 500 meters inland and over hills that were 10 meters high. The tsunami originated from an area which is at 8 deg 32 min S - 123 deg 30 min E, on the southern coast of Lembata Island.\r\nThe waves deposited 2 meters thick of sand on coastal settlements. A total of 187 persons were killed, most of them found buried under the sand, 32 persons were seriously injured, and 364 persons were missing. The 3 villages (Labala, Waiteba and Bobu), with population totalling 3,422, were completely obliterated. According to the Smithsonian Institution&#39;s SEAN Bulletin of July 31, 1979, the meteorology and geophysics station at Kupang recorded an earthquake of undetermined magnitude at 00:42 local time on 18 July, located in the Sawu Sea (south of Lomblen). Light rocks, dead fishes, and oil film were found floating on the coastal waters, days after the tsunami. The coastline shifted 20 meters inland. The sites where a school, a health centre and a government building were located, are now under the sea. (Reference #3330)\r\n</p><p>1979, July 17 [18]. A tsunami generated by a landslide struck the south coast of Lomblen Island, Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia. The landslide, which occurred on the south coast of Lembata Island,was possibly triggered by a small earthquake in the Sawu Sea. Four villages on Lomblen were destroyed with 187 killed and 364 missing. (Reference #45)</p>",

The reported number of fatalities associated with this event that occurred between April and June 1781 is inconsistent between all entries. Three out of four entries that record this event provide details of a tsunami. The death of one woman was reported in 2 entries with reference made to &#34;Taiwan interview catalogue&#34; (Chen et al., 1830). In contrast, Yang (1987) recorded &gt;50 000 deaths associated with a tsunami caused by a Taiwan Strait earthquake in May. In citing &gt;50 000 deaths Yang also quoted descriptions from Chen et al. (1830). The death toll reported for this event appears erroneous since it is not cited in the detailed publications of Soloviev and Go (1974), and Zhou and Adam (1986). However, the inclusion of the 1781 tsunami-like event into the work of Yang (1987) has been generally accepted and this &#34;deadly&#34; tsunami report is now widely quoted among Chinese literatures (e.g. Wang and Bao, 1992; Ye et al., 2005). </p><p>The Yang (1987) record of the 1781 April-June event (#14) is possibly the best example of how erroneous reporting can arise when including information from previous publications.

The descriptions are similar to those for the 22 May 1782 event (#15) recorded for Taiwan by Iida et al. (1967) and Soloviev and Go (1974). Therefore, it appears very likely that Yang (1987) mixed details of the 1782 event with that of 1781 when composing the tsunami event list.</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #10200:</i></blockquote>   <p>This sea-surge occurred somewhere between 24 April 1781 and 21 June 1781, at Qieteng Bay, Taiwan (near the current Dapeng Bay, Donggang, approximately 30 km southeast to Kaohsiung) [Q8]. The flood was reported to last for a few quarters, which is a typical period of a tsunami. Based on conditions 1 and 2 (see Sect. 4.1.1 and 4.1.2), this event is sufficient to be validated as tsunami. The weather was reported to be fine, eliminating the possibility of a storm surge. No earthquake was reported in the region in this period, suggesting that the tsunami was probably not tectonic in origin. The run-up was reported both quantitatively (tens of zhangs) and qualitatively (about a bamboo high). One woman was reported to be drowned. The reporter&#39;s name was also recorded, which was not a common practice in local historiographies, giving support to the reliability of the report. The event was not recorded in the official dynastic record, possibly because the damage was minor.
