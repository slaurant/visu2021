On Friday night, 5\r\nFebruary 1641, there was a destructive earthquake in\r\nthe region between Tabriz and Lake Urmiyeh in Azarbaijan.\r\nThe districts of Usku and Khusraushah on the northwest slopes of mount Sahand, as well as Dehkhwarqan (modern Azarshahr), were totally destroyed with great loss of life. In Tabriz many houses and public buildings collapsed, among them most of the famous historical monuments. The half-ruined complex of buildings of Sham-i Ghazan, situated about 5 km west of the city fell in leaving only the four corners of the main structure standing. The Masjid-i Ustad-Shagird was partly destroyed, as was most probably the &#39;Alishah mosque which also stood in a ruined state in the centre of Tabriz. The shock particularly affected the domes and minarets of mosques, which fell shattered to the ground,\r\nand also the main buildings in the city, although some of\r\nthem were already largely in ruins by this time. Damage\r\nextended to neighbouring districts and in all the earthquake caused the deaths of 1200 people.\r\n <p>1641. In Persia, also felt at Baghdad. Lasted altogether 3 days. In the province Aziron the towns Rik and Riangasan were ruined. (reference #521)</p>",

Many houses were destroyed and many persons perished under the wreckage. Another shock, preceded by the same kind of rumbling, occurred at 05:00 (Local time). At 06:00 (or 06:30, Local time), prolonged tremors recurred and they were accompanied by a terrible boom. Church bells rang by themselves, and buildings that were still standing were destroyed. However, there were few casualties, since the people, hearing the rumblings, ran into the streets. A total of 100 persons perished in Lima.<p>Damage from this earthquake was reported as far away as 700 km south of Lima. Settlements along the rivers Ica, Palca, Nasca and Camana suffered particularly heavy damage. A third earthquake inflicted serious damage to houses and churches of Arequipa. Large crevasses, many kilometres long, appeared in the earth between Ica and Canete. The damage in Pisco reflected the strong vibrations the area had suffered.

(ref #11006)</p><p>R<i>ef #516</i>:<br />The Lisbon earthquake of 1755 has long held a place among the great earthquakes of the world. This it owes not only to the destruction of a well-known city or to the area disturbed by it, though the loss of life probably amounted to fifty or sixty thousand, and the region over which it mas felt must have contained more than a million sq. miles. It would seem rather to be due to a feature that has not, in any other earthquake, been so widely and notably observed-the remarkable seiches or oscillations of the water in lakes far beyond the limits of the disturbed area, in countries so distant as the north of Scotland and the centre of Sweden.</p><p>No trustworthy estimate has ever been made of the total loss of life in Lisbon and elsewhere. None, indeed, was possible, for the bodies were removed from the city without being counted. The earthquake occurred on All Saints&#39; Day, at the time of the first mass, and thousands were collected in the churches. Most of these were killed, for very few of the churches and convents escaped destruction. The number of killed in Lisbon alone is usually placed at about 30,000, but some estimates rise as high as 50, 60 and even 70, thousand. These figures, it should be noted, take no account of the losses in other places such as Faro, where 3,000 persons are said to have been killed, or Fez, Mequinez, Morocco and other towns in North Africa, in or near which many thousands of lives were lost.</p><p>In the lower part of the city, the destruction of property in the narrow streets was almost universal. Less than three weeks after the earthquake, one writer went over the ruined city. &#34;There are&#34;, he says, &#34;no signs of streets, lanes, squares, etc., but hills and mountains of rubbish still smoking&#34;. Out of about 20,000 houses in Lisbon, there remained hardly 3,000 that were habitable with safety. Among those lost or seriously damaged, must be reckoned 32 churches, more than 60 small chapels, 31 monasteries, 15 nunneries and 53 palaces.</p><p>The damage wrought by the earthquake was completed by the fires that broke out some minutes later in six or seven different places, and soon spread over the ruined city. The outbreak of fire was due mainly to the fall of curtains and woodwork on kitchen fires and on the candles and lamps that illuminated the altars in every church and chapel in the city, and, to a slight extent, on the work of incendiaries bent on plundering the ruins. The fires, aided by a violent wind, continued burning for six days, without any attempt being made to stop their progress, until most of what the earthquake had spared was consumed.</p>",

A few kilometres to the east, southeast of Kisakata, several square kilometers of rice fields subsided 3 m. In the east, the boundary of the pleistoseismic zone included the Chokai volcano. In the Yuri district (Akita Prefecture) situated to the north of the volcano, <b>1,200 homes collapsed and 184 people died</b>. In Akumi district (Yamagata Prefecture), situated south of the volcano, <b>3,400 homes collapsed and 153 people died</b>.\r\n</p><p>Roads and bridges were damaged, fields were spoiled, and avalanches occurred in the mountains. Three homes collapsed on Tobi Island. In the lower reaches of the Elogami River, near Sakata, the ground cracked and numerous water fountains  gushed up to a height of 3 m, as a result of which the lowlands were flooded to a depth of 1.5 m. At the Nadicho temple (55 km from Kisakata), the stone lamps collapsed. There was no damage at Kameda, Kakunodate, and on Sado Island. At Odate, the clay walls cracked in the warehouses on the alluvial soils of the Noshiro River. It is possible that the earthquake was felt in the northern part of Chiba Prefecture.\r\n</p><p>To the north and south of the Chokai volcano, the coast rose. At Kisakata, the rise was more than 2 m.

The quake was preceded by foreshocks from the 14th to the 17th. The earthquake continued 2.5 to 3 min and the strongest vibrations lasted 40 sec. The epicenter was located 25-30 km to the north or northeast of Valparaiso. At the time of the most severe shocks, the ocean receded in the epicentral zone, only to rise and advance upon the shore again and again.<p>In Concon, three shocks were felt within a period of 5 minutes. The second shock was the strongest and lasted 2 min. It was accompanied by a frightening rumbling sound which seemed to originate below ground. Strange atmospheric glows may have been recorded as well. One building sustained broken windows and damaged roof tiles. Other houses and a mill were damaged more severely. The canal connecting the mill with the River Aconcagua was filled with material from collapsed river banks, and the ground became littered with cracks of different dimensions.</p><p>In Qintero, the vibrations shook the palms and caused them to lean permanently. Huge cracks appeared along the lakeshore, and almost all the houses were damaged and became uninhabitable. There were fires and casualties. In Casablanca, no houses remained standing. In Quillota, many houses were destroyed and the remainder were damaged. Only 20 houses and one church remained standing. Vina del Mar suffered almost complete destruction. The whole plain appeared to be strewn with cones of small sand volcanoes of a height of 0.3-1.2 m. Damage was recorded in Limache and in La Ligua. Close to 200 casualties were recorded in the above areas. In Valparaiso, most of the public buildings and almost 700 private houses were destroyed. All bell towers and turrets collapsed. The port area of Almendral, situated on alluvial soil, sustained severe damage. All houses built of mud bricks disintegrated. <b>72 persons (over 300, according to other sources) perished</b> and over 200 were injured, mostly in brick buildings. Wooden houses were not damaged, but old stone fortifications sustained some damage. The stream discharge in Valparaiso increased, and new streams appeared but soon dried up.</p><p>The shore at Valparaiso rose approximately 1m [This is disputed by some sources.] Cracks appeared in coastal granite cliffs, and rockslides took place.</p><p>At Concon, the sea coast rose 0.3-1.2m. The maximum rise probably averaged 1.5-2m, and it probably occurred 3-5km from shore. As a result of the lifting of the ocean floor, numerous rocks appeared above the water level in areas off Valparaiso, Concon and Quintero. The shore eventually slowly subsided, returning to its pre-earthquake level.</p><p>Miners in the gold mines of El Bronse in Petorgue worked at a depth of 170m at the time of the earthquake. The earthquake caused cave-ins in the shafts and some of the <b>miners were trapped in the lateral drifts and perished</b>. In Illapel, all the churches were damaged; and severe damage was caused in San Felipe.</p><p>In Santiago, no one was killed, but about 30 public buildings were damaged. The earthquake caused the same amount of damage in Aconcagua.</p><p>Some buildings were damaged in Melipilla. The earthquake was felt in San Jose de Maipo, San Fernando, Talka, Rancaqua and Concepcion, but no damage was recorded. To the south, the quake was recorded as far as Valdivia; to the east, as far as Mendosa, Cordoba and San Juan. In the north the earthquake was felt up to Copiapo. According to some data, a seaquake [T-phase] was recorded on vessels anchored in Callao.</p><p>Repeated tremors in the epicentral zone of the earthquake  were recorded at least until Oct 1822.</p><p>(above from ref #415)</p><p>1822, Nov 19 10:15 pm local time. 72 people were killed in Valpariso, largely in adobe buildings.

Reaching the river bank, he was obliged to run back, since the water was rapidly surging on shore, rising a metre (several feet). However, the water just as rapidly receded, but surged onto the opposite shore with a\r\nnoise like peals of thunder, and then gradually retreated. All this lasted no more than a minute. Returning home, the eyewitness found that pieces of stucco had fallen from the ceiling, and the walls had cracked. At least 22 cracks were counted in the walls of one room alone. However, there was no serious damage in the city and only <b>one person died</b>. The earthquake was stronger in the provinces.

        "comments": "1833, Sept 18, at 6 hrs exactly, disastrous earthquake unleashing all its violence at the beginning and without any precursor noise. The English traveler, Mr. John Reid, from whom he took the details that followed\u0085 recorded a duration of 45 sec, the movement was horizontal with 2 or 3 wave oscillations per sec. The subterraneous noise that accompanied it was frightening and superior to the strongest thunderclaps. Of <b>1200 houses of which the city was composed, at least 1000 more were destroyed, and many people perished</b>.<p>In the dusk that preceded this earthquake, like the one that preceded the one of Oct 8, 1831, the atmosphere was very heavy, with a frightful calm that was not interrupted, but at times, by a kind of almost insensible breeze that seemed to have no direction, and that felt enclosed between the houses, as well as in the streets. The air seemed to be in a state of great electrical tension...</p><p>According to another observer, Mr. Mathie Hamilton\u0085, there would have been 16, a considerable collision with downward directed vertical movement upwards. At the great movement of 18, a series of light movements took place that were repeated for several days. The rain (extraordinary phenomenon) fell almost every day and for 6 weeks. In Arica, during the first week of October, there was a flood of rain such that there had not been half a century. The river that passes through Tacna, was not disturbed, but others varied their courses, having one of them disappeared.</p><p>Seismic expansion stretched several hundred miles to the south, towards the Atacama desert. In Luto, almost 40 miles away cracks formed in the ground, from where emanated a black liquid. In the Province of Tarapaca, several villages were entirely devastated, in one of them that was located on a ravine was swallowed with all their habitants. To the north side, the ravages also extended. The villages of Sama, distant about 30 miles, and Lacumba about 60, were destroyed. Moquegua at a distance of 120 miles experienced great ruin and Arequipa, although violently shaken, was hardly damaged. The effects of this disastrous movement extended to the high peaks of Upper Peru; church of Tacora, 15,000 ft above sea level, knocked down concomitantly. After this calamity, the atmosphere returned to its clarity in the whole mountain range, so that it would be possible to distinguish Tacna, which presented in a multitude of points, an entirely new aspect. Large masses fell or slipped in the ravines and in the valleys, leaving numerous peaks naked and deprived of their original features. Mr. Scott, an engineer and employee at Ochozumo, a station at nearly 14,500 ft, described the movements, which I describe as terrible. With his long view he could see how the masses were detached from the mountains, one of them leaving an empty space as big as the Plaza de San Enoch in Glasgow.</p><p>La Paz, was another of the places of the high Peru, shaken of extraordinary way. This earthquake struck the coast of Peru for about 100 miles.</p><p>(above from ref #1211)</p><p>&#34;By the English brig Arab, from Arica, we are informed of the desolation of that place, and Tacna, by a dreadful earthquake which was experienced there on the 18th inst. That but 13 or 14 houses are left in Arica, appears certain, and the number of lives lost is estimated at from 6 to 700. Tacna is  said to be totally destroyed. The beautiful valley of Zapa is laid waste. The famous White Bluff (about 200 feet in height) on the right hand as you enter the harbour of Arica is now nearly on a level with the ocean; and two small islands on the same side are sunk so that a frigate can sail over them. The first shock was felt about half past 10 o&#39;clock, P.M., and was succeeded by three others at intervals of 2, 3 and 5 minutes, the last of which was most severe.<b>The sea rose about 30 feet higher than usual.</b>&#34;(ref #11719)</p><p>18 killed, 25 injured.

The earthquake left marked traces in the provinces of Rizal and Bulacan. It was less strong in the provinces of Cavite, Pampanga, Laguna and beyond them. It was not felt in the north, in Pangasinan Province. In all about <b>400 people died and 2,000 were injured</b> in the country, mainly in the capital. </p><p>The extent and force of the earthquake can be judged by the fact that churches, which were the most numerous stone buildings of that time, collapsed or were very heavily damaged at Manila and in the nearest settlements of Pasig, Taguig, Cainta, San Mateo, Bocaue, and also in the cities of Las Pisas, Bacoor, Maragondon, Polo, Santa Maria, Bulacan, Malolos, San Rafael, Angat, San Isidro, Euiginto, Lubao, Cabugao, San Pedro, Tunasan, Tanay, and Pililla (provinces of Cavite, Bulacan, Pampanga, and Laguna). </p><p>There was also extensive destruction at the cities of Binondo, Santa Cruz, Lipa, Tondo, San Miguel, Tambobo, and Navotas.

Damage was less serious in\r\nAydin except in the Turkish quarter where a few\r\nhundred houses collapsed, together with two minarets\r\nof the Great Mosque, the chimney stack of Atkinson&#39;s\r\nmachine factory and a number of churches and\r\nsynagogues. The shock caused considerable damage\r\nto the railway line east of Aydin, towards Cal and Denizli: embankments slumped, leaving rails suspended\r\n2 metres in the air and bridges were damaged\r\nat Balikdere, Gemelli and Karatas near Saraykoy.\r\nTelegraph communications were also interrupted east\r\nof Aydin, the poles supporting wires east of Kuyucak\r\nand Gemelli having collapsed. The shock triggered\r\nmany landslides, one of which destroyed Ortakgi,\r\nwhich was abandoned; Kemer and its nearby bridge,\r\nand sites west of Cine were also damaged by slides.\r\nLiquefaction-induced ground failures were reported\r\nfrom throughout the Menderes valley, particularly\r\nfrom near Kogarli, Sahinli and from as far as Cellat.\r\n<p>Long-period effects were experienced in Izmir, Mugla\r\nand Isikli, where a minaret was damaged, and the\r\nshock was felt as far away as Thrace, Marmara,\r\nEskisehir and Rhodes. Small aftershocks, mostly in\r\nthe western part of the epicentral region, and some\r\nlocally damaging, continued well into 1900. The\r\nearthquake <b>killed 1117 people and injured hundreds\r\nmore; it destroyed 7126 houses</b> and damaged a\r\nfurther 8756. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1215)\r\n</p><p></p>",

There was a catastrophic earthquake in California, which destroyed San Francisco. It was caused by a right-hand horizontal shift of the flanks of the San Andreas fault by up to 4 1/2-6 m on a stretch of 350 to 550 km, according to different estimates. The earthquake began with weak oscillations, and lasted, according to different estimates, from 1 to 3 1/2 minutes. At San Francisco, according to official data, 28,188 homes were destroyed; about 380 people died. The fire which broke out did more damage than the earthquake itself. The destruction from seismic oscillations was largely due to the settling of filled in ground. The settling varied from 10 cm to 1 m. At several places on the coast, homes slid downward towards the sea by up to 1/2 m (2 feet). Everywhere on the high steep coast from Mendosino Cape to Cabo Delgada, on a stretch of many kilometers, slopes collapsed into the sea. On the lower coast between Shelter Cove and Point Arena, bedrocks and loose material slipped into the sea, and the water was turbid for several days after the earthquake (Reference #415).</p>",

Seibert (1930) estimated an intensity of X-X in the epicentral area; somewhat exaggerated in view of the type of antique construction. Within this area the provinces of Piura, Huancabamba, and Jaen in Peru and the coastal towns\r\nof Ecuador, including Guayas, were affected. The city of\r\nPiura, with many buildings, was most affected, only one percent of them being left habitable. The statistics of the epoch evaluate the losses at a million and half soles. Cracks were formed on the Piura River, with spouting of water. Damage to the railroad embankment. In the village of Huancabamba (1967 m above sea level) it caused cracking of walls, collapse of one bridge and the ruin of others.\r\nAt the harbor of Paita the ground cracked and damage was considerable. In the city of Trujillo and the port of Salaverry it was estimated to have an intensity of VII.\r\nThe macroseismic epicenter, judging from Picon (1926), was situated in the department of Piura in a region of \r\nthe Cordillera Occidental, between east of Huanca, NE of Piura, and NW of Huancabamba.

It was the strongest (or one of the strongest) since the island had been discovered by Europeans. It began suddenly, without perceptible preliminary shocks. It was accompanied by a &#34;noisy roar&#34; which, according to eyewitnesses, was like the roar of heavily loaded moving trucks or of a hundred horses galloping over a large wooden stage. \r\n</p><p>The intensity was 6-7 degrees (VII-VI11 Rossi-Forel). The zone of damage extended 40 km to the north-north-east direction and included Mactan Island, Cebu City and the central part of Cebu Island to the north of Cebu. On Mactan Island and north of Cebu, cracks appeared in the alluvial soils and on the steep calcareous shores and hillsides, and also in the cement floors of the buildings here. The cracking of the ground frightened the population, who feared an explosion of the volcano. The tile roofs which are widely used on Cebu Island were damaged; three of them partially collapsed, including the very old, steep roof of a monastery. Damage was also recorded where drainage pipes, wooden and cement staircases met walls and the ground. Hairline cracks appeared in the walls themselves of buildings; only old homes, as a rule built of coral lime - stone blocks, were damaged. In addition, at Cebu, two very old walls standing alone fell on the huts, made of leaves, sheltered by the walls, <b>killing five people</b>. None of the concrete buildings, made out of good lime mortar, suffered any damage. Old, but well repaired houses, were also unharmed. No collapses or slumps were recorded in the coal mine near Cebu. \r\n</p><p>The earthquake was strong on the Camotes Islands and on the western coast of Leyte Island. It was felt on the islands of Leyte, Samar, Bohol, Negros, and on the east of Panay Island. The tremors were barely noticeable on Burias Island. The large axis of the area of perceptibility extended to the north-north-east and had a length of about 400 km. The earthquake was accompanied by recurrent shocks, the force of which occasionally reached 4-5 degrees.\r\n</p><p>Unusual movements of the sea were noticed after the earthquake in the passage between Cebu and Mactan Islands and around the northern tip of Cebu Island. The underwater cable, running from the northern tip of Cebu Island to Masbate Island, as well as the cable connecting Masbate and Burias Islands, was cut on the same day, The exact time of the breakage of the cables is unknown.\r\n</p><p>[27.II; 20h39m50S; 10.2 N, 124.1 E; M&#61;6.25.]\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1187:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1922, February 28, 9:14 a.m. (Origin far from Cebu): Cebu Island - Intensity IV-V.

This was the strongest earthquake in this region since 1810. \r\n</p><p>According to the seismic station at Akita, the earthquake consisted of two shocks. The second shock occurred about 1 minute 40 seconds after the first and apparently was somewhat stronger. Both shocks were also clearly registered on the tide gauge record at Tsuchizaki, west of Akita. \r\n</p><p>After the earthquake, a tsunami was observed on the coast of the Oga Peninsula. \r\n</p><p>Iida et al.

The epicenter was in the Beni-Rached hills (36 deg 17 min N., 1 deg 28 min E.) in the centre of a zone where the terrain is slashed with breaks and fractures over a total length of 20 km. The Algiers-Oran railway line subsided at several points and there was considerable damage done to the Ponteba Dam and the main water-pipe for\r\nirrigating the plain of Chelif; the damage has been studied in detail; in the zone close to the.epicentre, the best-constructed public works suffered damage; the Ponteba Darn was tilted 55 cm along 80 m of its length; precision surveying along the irrigation pipes after the earthquake showed that certain points had risen over 1.5 m. Several underwater cables were snapped on 9 September off the Algerian coast in a zone 100 km from the epicentre. J. P. Rothe believes that this was due to currents of mud set in motion by the shock on the edge of the continental plateau.\r\n(reference #1040)\r\n</p><p>Sea of Alboran.

        "comments": "The Guatemalan earthquake of February 4, 1976, with a surface-wave magnitude of 7.6, was generated by left-lateral slippage on the Motagua fault and was felt over an area of at least 100,000 km<sup>2</sup>. This earthquake claimed more than 22,700 lives and injured more than 76,000 people. The preliminary estimate of losses is about $1,100,000,000. \r\n<p>Ground breakage was observed and mapped for a distance  of nearly 240 km along a segment of the fault. It is the longest surface rupture to have occurred in America since 1906. The inferred total length of faulting is nearly 300 km, postulated on the basis of small aftershocks and high damage concentration west of Guatemala City. Maximum horizontal slippage as measured on the fault, about 26 km north of Guatemala City, was 326 cm. The average horizontal displacement is approximately 100 cm. Slippage also occurred on a number of secondary faults and caused damage to houses and other structures in the vicinity of Guatemala City.\r\n</p><p>The February 4 earthquake caused extensive landsliding along the highway that leads from Guatemala City to the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Landslides also blocked many railroads and destroyed many communication routes in the highlands of Guatemala. A large landslide near Tecpan covered two small villages and dammed a river. Additional landslides were triggered by aftershock activity.\r\n</p><p>The maximum Modified Mercalli intensity was IX in the Mixco area, in some sections of Guatemala City, and in Gualhn. The Modified Mercalli intensity reached VI over an area of 33,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The concentration of high intensities observed near the western end of the Motagua fault suggests the influence of a westward-propagating fault rupture. \r\n</p><p>Communities and small towns that suffered 100 percent damage covered an area of 1,700 km<sup>2</sup>. At some localities, adobe structures near the causative fault (within 10 km) were essentially undamaged; at greater distances from the fault in the highlands, there was widespread collapse of adobe buildings. Modern earthquake-resistive structures in Guatemala City were damaged, including several hospitals. Several water tanks and corrugated-steel grain silos and numerous heavy parapets collapsed.\r\n</p><p>(above from ref #3343)\r\n</p><p>This event is located near Los Amateos about 157 km northeast of Guatemala City. It was generated by a left-lateral slippage of about 1 m on the Motagua fault. An estimated 23,000 were killed, more than 76,000 were injured, and it was felt over an area of at least 100,000 sq km. The maximum MM intensity was IX in the Mixco area. In some sections of Guatemala City and in Gualan, the MM Intensity reached VI over an area of 33,000 sq km. Communities and small towns that suffered 100% adobe damage covered an area of 1,700 sq km.

The earthquake and tsunami associated with it were responsible for the destruction of at least six fishing villages and the death of hundreds of people in the Narino State of Colombia. The earthquake was felt in Bogota, Cali, Popayan, Buenaventura and other major cities and villages in Colombia and in Guayaquil, Esmeraldas, Quito and other parts of Ecuador.\r\n<p>Hardest hit by the earthquake and tsunami was Charco, a Colombian fishing village of 4,000 persons--about 300 km north of the Ecuadorian border, where 100% of all the houses were either seriously damaged or totally destroyed. Most of the houses at Charco were built on stilts over a lake. it is not known at this time whether the houses were destroyed by the earthquake or by wave action. Numerous deaths and injuries were reported from this area. Most of the victims were women and children. Hundreds of people at Charco had to sleep on the ground following the disaster and had to go without food and drinking water for several days.\r\n</p><p>The second populated area that was hardest hit by the earthquake was the seaport of Tumaco, only about 80 km from the earthquake epicenter. At least 40 persons were killed and 750 injured by the earthquake, which destroyed approximately 10% of the houses and other buildings in the town of 80,000. Included in the buildings that were destroyed was the four-story las Americas Hotel.\r\n</p><p>Tumaco is built on an island made up of alluvial deposits of Rio Mira and Rio Caunapi. In fact the whole area appears to have formed from deltaic deposits. Evidence of liquefaction was evident in many areas of the city of Tumaco where structures failed and it was particularly evident along sections of the waterfront. Evidence of subsidence was found on either side of the bridge connecting the island where Tumaco is situated to the island where the airport is located. It appeared that the island dropped by as much as 60 cm.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #3330)\r\n</p><p>Fatalities, injuries and extensive damage in the Pasto, Tumaco, Guapi, and Buenaventura areas and on Gorgona Island, Colombia.</p><ul><li>Reference #1053 lists 600 deaths, 20,000 injured and extensive damageReference #1250 lists 300 deaths, 1,500 injured, $8 million damage.Reference #2065 quotes the Red Cross figure of 643 deaths, 1,875 injured, 72 missing.Reference #2065 also quotes the Department of Civil Defense figure of 454 deaths, 1,047 injured, and 125 missing.</li></ul>\r\n<p>Depth is listed in Ramirez and Goberna (Ref #2065) as 33 km; they give a magnitude of 7.9 (Richter). The event produced a number of aftershocks, and also a tsunami. Many of the fatalities were caused by the tsunami, but these are generally not delineated from overall earthquake deaths. In the interior lands, damage was less. \r\n</p><p>EM-DAT (Ref #1250) lists $8 million in damage; the National Department of Planning (Ref #2065) calculated damage to housing, highways, and public services at upwards of $710 million.</p>",

(reference #1053)\r\n<p>1992, May 20. 36 deaths, 2100 affected. (reference #1250)\r\n</p><p>Throughout most of the Himalaya, slip of the Indian Plate is restrained by friction on the interface between the plate and the overlying wedge of Himalayan rocks. Every few hundred years, this interface-or decollement-ruptures in one or more Mw<u>&gt;</u>8 earthquakes. In contrast, in the westernmost Himalaya, the Indian Plate slips aseismically beneath wide plateaux fronting the Kohistan Mountains. The plateaux are underlain by viscous decollements that are unable to sustain large earthquakes. Potwar, the widest of these plateaux is underlain by viscous salt, which currently permits it to slide at rates of about 3mmyr<sup>-1</sup>, much slower than its 2 Myr average. This deceleration has been attributed to recently increased\r\nfriction through the loss of salt from its decollement. Here\r\nwe use interferometric synthetic aperture radar and seismic\r\ndata to assess movement of the Kohat Plateau-the narrowest\r\nand thickest plateau. We find that in 1992 an 80 km<sup>2</sup> patch of the d\u00e9collement ruptured in a rare Mw6.0 earthquake, suggesting that parts of the decollement are locally grounded. We conclude that this hybrid seismic and aseismic behaviour represents an evolution of the mode  of slip of the plateaux from steady creep towards increasingly widespread seismic rupture.

With the second earthquake, it is estimated that at least 41,302 additional homes were destroyed and another 15,706 were severely damaged, mostly in the departments of San Vicente, La Paz and Cuscatlan. Within the space of 30 days, from the 13th of January to the 13th of February, El Salvador suffered two major earthquakes that caused damages of approximately US$1.66 billion. The two disasters left 1,159 people dead and 8,122 wounded. They destroyed 149,528 houses and damaged 185,338. In many cases, these dwellings\r\ndoubled as the places where people generated their family incomes. It is estimated that approximately 41,400 small and micro enterprises have been affected in this way. The total number of those directly affected reaches 1,532,919 people, roughly 25% of the population. The situation is worsened by the enormous damage caused to the country&#39;s social and economic infrastructure, as well as its environmental conditions, all of which will make recovery even more difficult.

Fires broke out in places. There was considerable destruction at Kyoto. <p>The Japanese literature reports a colossal landslide without indicating the exact location.

The tremors ceased only after 40 days and extended from Sakata District to Kyoto Prefecture. Sixty homes collapsed at Sakai...At Kyoto, many buildings collapsed, including a famous temple with many idols ... In Gifu Prefecture, a fortress was situated on a high mountain. After numerous strong shocks, the earth opened up and swallowed the mountain and the fortress. In their place appeared a lake. The same occurred in Ika District as well... The palaces at Osaka felt very strong tremors, but nevertheless were not toppled...\r\n</p><p>In Shiga Prefecture at the town of Nagahama, which had about a thousand homes and was often visited by traders, a fire broke out and destroyed half the city. Terrible tremors lasted many days. Then the sea (Lake Biwa) surged on the city with such force that the water pushed over all the buildings and carried them off together with all the inhabitants. Not a trace remained of the rich trading city, except for the castle, and even that was underwater.\r\n</p><p>The data about this wave in the Japanese literature are apparently so vague, that different specialists have mistakenly attributed the tsunami to the Pacific or to the Sea of Japan [coast of Honshu Island]\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #414)\r\n</p><p>Jan 18, 1586.

The mountain settlements of Englam-Mana, Sambal-Mana and Saguana-Mana suffered especially. Somewhat later, at dawn, strong waves fell on shore, and destroyed the forest in many places. It washed up pebbles on shore in such amounts that not a few rivers were dammed. High flood tides and a heavy surf were still noticed at sea during the whole of the next day.\r\n</p><p>On visiting the mountain villages, he found numerous yawning cracks in the ground running north-south. The blockage of the mouths of the rivers entailed a change in their channels, while the subsidence of some parts of the coast led to the formation of numerous lagoons and swamps. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #79:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1873, Spring, source area: Macclay Co., New Guinea, Vilyaz Strait, observed on Maclay Coast, New Guinea. </p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #99:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1873, Spring, Maclay Coast, New Guinea.\r\n<br />1873-1876, June. Remarks by de Miklouho- Maclay, 1884. The natives told me that during my absence they had experienced on the coast and the mountains several earthquakes, on which occasions some natives were killed by the falling of cocoanut trees in the villages, which in falling destroyed the huts. The villages on the coast suffered more on account of unusually big waves which followed soon after the earthquake, breaking down the cocoanut trees and sweeping away a few huts nearest to the beach. In revisiting the coast villages, I found many not unimportant changes: stretches of destroyed forest by tidal waves after the earthquake; alteration in the direction of some small streams, the old mouths of which had been closed by bars of sand left behind by waves. He noted intensive landsliding which suggested an epicentre in the Finisterre Range.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #11528:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>An earthquake caused the collapse of many huts, especially in the mountain villages.Around sunrise, a tsunami struck that destroyed forests and threw debris on land, blocking the mouths of river estuaries. Rivers changed their courses, fissures were observed, and sinkholes and lagoons were formed. Likely source: New Britain Trench.</p>",

This first shock did no damage, but so frightened the populace that they rushed into the streets, thus very materially descreasing the probable eath-rate. Within two or three minutes came the most violent shock, which leveled all the buildings of the village except two. Thirty-nine deaths were caused by the shocks, as were many injuries.

At this latitude, the Okhotsk plate is converging to the west-northwest towards the Amur plate with a velocity of about 9 mm/yr. The Amur and Okhotsk plate are themselves relatively small plates that lie between the Eurasia plate and the Pacific plate. The Pacific plate converges west-northwest towards the Eurasia plate at over 90 mm/yr. Most of the relative motion between the Pacific plate and the Eurasia plate is accommodated approximately 400 km to the east-southeast of the epicenter of the earthquake, where the Pacific plate subducts beneath the Okhotsk plate.\r\n</p><p>This shallow crustal earthquake was followed 13 hours later by a deep focus magnitude 6.8 quake roughly 330 km to the west, 350 km below the Sea of Japan. The two earthquakes were generated by different mechanisms. The first earthquake was caused by deformation within the crust of the Okhotsk plate and the second quake was likely caused by faulting resulting from internal deformation of the subducted Pacific plate. Given their different mechanisms and physical separation of at least 10 rupture lengths, the second earthquake is not considered an aftershock of the first.\r\n</p><p>Shallow earthquakes cause more damage than intermediate- and deep-focus ones since the energy generated by the shallow events is released closer to the surface and therefore produces stronger shaking than is produced by quakes that are deeper within the Earth. Other deadly earthquakes have occurred in this region: In 2004, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred in the Niigata Prefecture, 50 km to the southeast of the recent quake, killing 40 people and injuring about 3,000. In June, 1964, a M7.5 earthquake occurred about 115 km to the \r\nnorth-northeast of the recent quake, killing 37 people; and in April, 1995 a M5.4 earthquake 70 km to the northeast injured at least 39 people. \r\n</p><p>During the 20th century Japan has suffered nine devastating earthquakes that killed more that 1000 people each. Among these are the 1923 M7.9 earthquake that triggered the great Tokyo fire that killed 143,000 people and the more recent 1995 M6.9 Kobe earthquake that killed about 5,500 people.\r\n</p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/img/20070716.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Earthquake Summary Poster</a></b> from the USGS National Earthquake Information Center.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>2007, July 16.

Possible earthquake lights observed at Lima.\r\n<p>This earthquake occurred at the boundary between the Nazca and South American tectonic plates. The two plates are converging at a rate of 78 mm per year. The earthquake occurred as thrust-faulting on the interface between the two plates, with the South American plate moving up and seaward over the Nazca plate. Coastal Peru has a history of very large earthquakes. The August 15 shock originated near the source of two earthquakes, both in the magnitude 8 range, that occurred in 1908 and 1974. The largest earthquake along the coast of Peru is the magnitude 9 that occurred in 1868.

More than 1,500 people were reported injured. The center of the destruction was in Peru&#39;s southern desert, in the city of Ica and the nearby port of Pisco. Pisco&#39;s mayor said at least 200 people were buried in the rubble of a church where they had been attending a service. In Ica, a city of 120,000 near the epicenter, a fourth of the buildings collapsed, at least 57 bodies were brought to the morgue. Several Ica churches also were damaged. Cable news station Canal N said 17 people were killed inside one. The quake knocked out telephone and mobile phone service between the capital and the disaster zone. Electricity also was cut, with power lines drooping dangerously into the streets. \r\n<p>In Chincha, a small town 20 miles north of Pisco, an AP Television News cameraman counted 30 bodies under bloody sheets on a patio of the badly damaged hospital. About 200 people were waiting to be treated in walkways and gardens, kept outside for fear that aftershocks could topple the cracked walls. Large areas were completely leveled; dozens of homes made with adobe bricks had collapsed. &#34;The dead are scattered by the dozens on the streets,&#34; Pisco Mayor Juan Mendoza told Lima radio station CPN. &#34;We don&#39;t have lights, water, communications. Most houses have fallen. Churches, stores, hotels - everything is destroyed,&#34; the mayor said, sobbing. In Lima, about 95 miles from the epicenter, only one death was recorded, and some homes collapsed. But the furious two minutes of shaking prompted thousands of people to flee into the streets and sleep in public parks for safety.\r\n</p></li></ul>",

An earthquake occurred 90 km WNW of Chengdu, Sichuan, China and 1545 km SW of Beijing, China.\r\n<p><b>Felt Report</b>\r\n<br />At least <b>69,185 people killed, 374,171\r\ninjured and 18,467 missing and presumed dead</b> in the\r\nChengdu-Lixian-Guangyuan area. More than 45.5 million\r\npeople in 10 provinces and regions were affected. At\r\nleast 15 million people were evacuated from their\r\nhomes and more than 5 million were left homeless. An\r\nestimated <b>5.36 million buildings collapsed</b> and more\r\nthan 21 million buildings were damaged in Sichuan and\r\nin parts of Chongqing, Gansu, Hubei, Shaanxi and\r\nYunnan. The total economic loss was estimated at <b>86\r\nbillion US dollars</b>. Beichuan, Dujiangyan, Wuolong and\r\nYingxiu were almost completely destroyed. Landslides\r\n and rockfalls damaged or destroyed several mountain\r\n roads and railways and buried buildings in the\r\n Beichuan-Wenchuan area, cutting off access to the\r\n region for several days. At least 700 people were\r\n buried by a landslide at Qingchuan. Landslides also\r\n dammed several rivers, creating 34 barrier lakes which\r\n threatened about 700,000 people downstream. A train\r\n was buried by a landslide near Longnan, Gansu. At\r\n least 2,473 dams sustained some damage and more than\r\n 53,000 km of roads and 47,000 km of tap water\r\n pipelines were damaged. About 1.5 km of surface\r\n faulting was observed near Qingchuan, surface cracks\r\n and fractures occurred on three mountains in the area,\r\n and subsidence and street cracks were observed in the\r\n city itself. Maximum intensity IX was assigned in the\r\n Wenchuan area. <b>Seiches were observed at Kotalipara,\r\nBangladesh</b>.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>Tectonic Summary</b>\r\n<br />\r\nThe Sichuan earthquake of May 12, 2008, occurred as the result of motion on a northeast striking reverse fault or thrust fault on the northwestern margin of the Sichuan Basin. The earthquake&#39;s epicenter and focal-mechanism are consistent with it having occurred as the result of movement on the Longmenshan fault or a tectonically related fault. The earthquake reflects tectonic stresses resulting from the convergence of crustal material slowly moving from the high Tibetan Plateau, to the west, against strong crust underlying the Sichuan Basin and southeastern China.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn a continental scale, the seismicity of central and eastern Asia is a result of northward convergence of the India plate against the Eurasia plate with a velocity of about 50 mm/y. The convergence of the two plates is broadly accommodated by the uplift of the Asian highlands and by the motion of crustal material to the east away from the uplifted Tibetan Plateau.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>At least 69,195 people killed, 374,177 injured and 18,392 missing and presumed dead in the Chengdu-Lixian-Guangyuan area. More than 45.5 million people in 10 provinces and regions were affected.  (reference #10015)\r\n</p><p>Direct economic losses for the May 12 Sichuan earthquake centered in Wenchuan County hit 845.1 billion yuan (about 121 billion U.S. dollars), an expert said hereon Thursday. \r\nThe southwestern province of Sichuan suffered the worst, accounting for 91.3 percent of the total direct economic losses, according to Shi Peijun with the Wenchuan earthquake expert panel. Its neighboring provinces Gansu and Shaanxi accounted for 5.8 and 2.9 percent of the total losses, respectively.

The epicenter was located about 55 km (35 miles) west-southwest of Bandar e-Abbas, Iran -- which is just across the narrow Strait of Hormuz from the United Arab Emirates -- according to U.S. Geological Survey. The quake shook nearby Dubai, where CNN staff members said they felt the building they were in shake for about 15 to 20 seconds. &#34;From my office window at the Dubai Media City where all foreign media are located, I can see that a lot of offices have evacuated buildings,&#34; CNN Dubai Bureau Chief Samson Desta said. &#34;I can see up to perhaps 200 people who have taken refuge out in the streets, causing somewhat of a traffic jam.&#34; There was no evidence of any damage in Dubai, where there are a lot of high-rise buildings.

The source region lies just south of the triple junction of the Philippine Sea plate, the Amur plate, and the Okhotsk plate (sometimes viewed as part of the North America plate) and is tectonically complex. In the epicentral region, the Philippine Sea plate subducts west or northwest beneath the Amur plate. Both the subducting Philippine Sea plate and the overriding Amur plate are seismically active due to high intraplate stresses, and the thrust-fault boundary between the plates is seismogenic. Present estimates of the earthquake&#39;s epicenter, focal-depth, and focal-mechanism suggest that the shock did not occur on the plate interface, but they do not permit us to confidently determine if the earthquake occurred within the Philippine Sea plate or the Amur plate.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)</p>",

The moment tensors of these earthquakes, describing their faulting mechanisms, are consistent with slip on either SW-NE trending faults with moderate dips towards the northwest, or approximately N-S trending faults steeply dipping towards the east. The events occurred in the boundary region between the South China Block and the southeastern Tibetan Plateau to the west. The principal boundary is commonly taken to be the well-expressed Xiaojiang fault system; the September 7 earthquakes occurred along faults approximately 100 km further east. Further work is necessary to identify the causative faults for these earthquakes, though active structures have been mapped in the surrounding region.\r\n</p><p>Many parts of southeastern China have a history of damaging earthquakes, and the area surrounding the September 7, 2012 earthquakes is no exception. 30 earthquakes of M5 or above have occurred within 100 km of these events over the past 40 years. Three had magnitudes greater than 5.5, and each of these caused damage and fatalities. The largest, a M 6.8 earthquake 80 km to the north of the September 7 events in May 1974, caused over 1500 fatalities. A M 5.6 earthquake just 30 km to the south of these events also caused several fatalities in November 2003. While the September 7, 2012 events are not considered large earthquakes, the high population density and high vulnerability of structures in the region make such shallow earthquakes particularly damaging.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>Officials from the local seismological authority in Yunnan Province said Sunday massive losses caused by recent earthquakes were mainly due to the special topography of the area, and rejected speculation that it should be attributed to human error such as jerry-built buildings.\r\nThe death toll in a series of earthquakes in Yiliang county, Zhaotong, in Southwest China&#39;s Yunnan, increased to 81 on Saturday after a 2-year-old boy failed to survive serious injuries received in a 3.7-magnitude aftershock on Saturday, according to the Zhaotong city government.\r\nAnother 821 people were injured in the quakes, after the first one of 5.6 magnitude hit an area near Yiliang at 11:19 am on Friday, and more than 200,000 people have been relocated, said a press release sent to the Global Times Sunday. The disaster caused about 4 billion yuan ($631 million) in direct losses. (reference #9976)\r\n</p><p>2012, July 9. 81 killed, 744,821 affected, $1000 million damage. (reference #1250)</p>",

Tectonics here are controlled by the convergence of the India plate with Eurasia, which has driven the uplift of the Himalayas to the west of this earthquake, and has caused the formation of numerous intraplate continental transform structures in the surrounding region.  The pattern of elastic-wave radiation from the earthquake is consistent with the shock occurring either as the result of right-lateral faulting on a northwest-trending fault or as the result of left-lateral faulting on a northeast trending fault.  Faults of both types have been mapped in southwestern Yunnan, and it is unclear at this time which type of fault hosted this event.  At the latitude of the October 7 earthquake, India moves northeastward with respect to Eurasia at a rate of approximately 51 mm/yr.\r\n</p><p>Strong earthquakes are reasonably common in the Yunnan province, and the bordering countries of Burma and Laos; the area within 500 km of the October 7 earthquake has hosted 44 other earthquakes of M 6 or above over the past century. Earthquakes here are also often damaging and deadly, as a result of the high vulnerability of most residential structures in this dominantly agricultural province. Nearby earthquakes in the M5-7 range in March 1979, November 1988, May 1989, January 1993, and June 2007, all caused fatalities - the largest, 110 km to the southwest in November 1988 (M 7.0) resulted in approximately 730 deaths. Within several hours of the 2014 earthquake, news reports indicate this M 6.0 event has caused limited fatalities, likely due to the sparse population nearby...\r\n</p><p>(reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>As of October 8, at least one person died and another 323 were injured in the earthquake which struck the county of Jinggu in the southern part of Yunnan the previous day, according to state media.

Focal mechanisms indicate rupture occurred on either a northwest-southeast striking right-lateral fault, or on a southwest-northeast striking left-lateral fault. At the latitude of this earthquake, the India plate is moving northwards with respect to Eurasia at a rate of approximately 38 mm/yr.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake is located several hundred kilometers north of the India:Eurasia plate boundary, in the Pamir Mountains. The collision of these two plates drives the tectonics of the broad region surrounding the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, and causes uplift that produces the highest mountain peaks in the world including the Himalayan, the Karakoram, the Pamir and the Hindu Kush ranges.\r\n</p><p>The location of the December 7, 2015 earthquake is close to Saraz Lake, which was formed in February 1911 when a nearby M 7.3 earthquake triggered a landslide that dammed the Murghab River. Over the past century, 18 other earthquakes of M 6.5 or larger have occurred within 250 km of the December 7, 2015 earthquake. Given the remoteness of the region, earthquakes here rarely cause shaking-related fatalities (though secondary hazards such as landsliding have caused both damage and fatalities in the past). \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>At least two people were killed and dozens injured when a powerful 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck dangerously close to a high-altitude lake in eastern Tajikistan, authorities in the Central Asian state said Tuesday...

Focal mechanisms indicate rupture occurred on a fault oriented either northwest-southeast, and dipping shallowly to the northeast, or on a north-south striking structure dipping steeply to the west. Taiwan lies in a region of complex tectonics, at the boundary between the Philippine Sea and Eurasia plates. To the north and east, the Philippine Sea plate subducts beneath Eurasia towards the north-northwest, along the Ryukyu Trench. South of the island, the South China Sea (on the the Eurasia plate) subducts to the east beneath the Philippine Sea plate at the Manila Trench. Moving north, subduction tectonics transition to arc-continent collision along the western side of Taiwan. At the location of the earthquake, the two plates converge in a northwest-southeast direction at a velocity of about 80 mm/yr.\r\n</p><p>Taiwan is the location of frequent seismicity, and 90 M 6.4&#43; events have occurred within 250 km of the February 5, 2016 event over the preceding century. Several of these earthquakes occurring beneath Taiwan (rather than in the subduction zone northeast of the island) have been destructive. A M 5.7 earthquake 70 km to the north of the February 2016 event in July 1998 caused 5 fatalities; a M 7.0 event in Dec 2006, 120 km to the south, caused 2 fatalities. The Chi-Chi earthquake (also Jiji, or 921 earthquake), a M 7.6 event in Sept 1999 just over 100 km north-northeast of the Feb 2016 event, caused widespread destruction and almost 2,500 fatalities. The 1999 event was the second deadliest earthquake in Taiwan history, after the April 1935 earthquake just north of Taichung, which caused over 3,200 fatalities. A M 7.3 earthquake in Dec 1941, between the cities of Tainan and Chiai and 55 km northwest of the Feb 2016 event, also caused several hundred fatalities. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11422:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p> Search and rescue operations after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake that struck southern Taiwan ended Saturday as the death toll rose to 116, Taiwan&#39;s Central News Agency reported. The last trapped person was rescued alive on Saturday afternoon, the city&#39;s disaster response office said. A total of 289 people were rescued, 96 people remain in hospital. Most of the fatalities and injuries came from the collapse of the Weiguan Golden Dragon high-rise tower in Tainan, the response center said. Aerial images in the immediate aftermath of the temblor showed the Weiguan Golden Dragon tower transformed into rubble. Structures around it remained intact. Rescuers found tin cans packed into the collapsed walls of the high-rise. &#34;There are so many other older buildings in Tainan that are still standing. Why was it only this building that was completely destroyed?&#34; asked Wang Xingyou, a city cab driver.

At the location of the earthquake, the Nazca plate subducts eastward beneath the South America plate at a velocity of 61 mm/yr. The location and mechanism of the earthquake are consistent with slip on the primary plate boundary interface between these two major plates. Subduction along the Ecuador Trench to the west of Ecuador, and the Peru-Chile Trench further south, has led to uplift of the Andes mountain range and has produced some of the largest earthquakes in the world, including the largest earthquake on record, the 1960 M 9.5 earthquake in southern Chile.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis earthquake is part of the aftershock sequence of the April 16, 2016 M 7.8 event. Since that mainshock, the region has experienced 5 aftershocks of M 6 or larger, including a M 6.7 earthquake which occurred 9 hours prior to this M 6.8 event on May 18.\r\n</p><p>\r\nEcuador has a history of large subduction zone related earthquakes. Prior to April 16, 2016, seven other magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes had occurred within 250 km of this event since 1900. On May 14th, 1942, a M 7.8 earthquake occurred 43 km south of this April 16th, 2016 event. On January 31st, 1906 a M 8.3 earthquake (reportedly as large as M 8.8 in some sources) nucleated on the subduction zone interface 90 km to the northeast of the April 2016, mainshock. The 1906 earthquake ruptured a fault patch approximately 400-500 km long, resulting in a damaging tsunami that caused between 500-1,500 fatalities. The April 2016 earthquake is at the southern end of the approximate rupture area of the 1906 event. A shallow, upper crustal M 7.2 earthquake 240 km east of the April 2016 event on March 6th, 1987 resulted in approximately 1,000 fatalities.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p> Two powerful earthquakes jolted Ecuador on Wednesday, causing one death and injuring dozens. President Rafael Correa said one person died in Manabi province in confusing circumstances that were still being investigated. At least 85 people were injured, two of them seriously. The president said that while some previously ravaged homes suffered more damage, most of those structures had already been evacuated and no buildings collapsed.

        "comments": "The February 16, 2018, M 7.2 earthquake in Oaxaca, Mexico, occurred as a result of shallow thrust faulting on or near the plate boundary between the Cocos and North America plates. The depth and focal mechanism solutions of the event are consistent with its occurrence on the subduction zone interface between these plates, approximately 90 km northeast of the Middle America Trench, where the Cocos plate begins its descent into the mantle beneath Mexico. In the region of this earthquake, the Cocos plate moves approximately northeastward at a rate of 60 mm/yr.\r\nHistorically, several significant earthquakes have occurred along the southern coast of Mexico. In 1932, a M 8.4 thrust earthquake struck in the region of Jalisco, several hundred kilometers to the northwest of the February 16th event. On October 9, 1995, a M 8.0 earthquake struck in the Colima-Jalisco region, resulting in at least 49 fatalities and leaving 1,000 people homeless. The deadliest nearby earthquake occurred on September 19, 1985, in the Michoacan region 500 km to the northwest of the February 16th event. This M 8.0 earthquake resulted in at least 9,500 fatalities, injured about 30,000 people, and left 100,000 people homeless. In 2003, a M 7.6 earthquake in Colima, Mexico, 680 km to the northwest of the March 20th event, resulted in 29 fatalities, destroyed more than 2,000 homes and left more than 10,000 people homeless. In March 2012, a M 7.4 earthquake 60 km to the northwest of the February 16, 2018 event killed 2 and injured 11 in the Oaxaca region. The hypocenter of the September 8th, 2017, M 8.2 earthquake offshore Chiapas is located 440 km southwest of today&#39;s earthquake. That event caused At least 78 fatalities and 250 injuries in Oaxaca, and a further 16 deaths in Chiapas. Eleven days later, a M 7.1 earthquake struck closer to Mexico City, 230 km northeast of today&#39;s earthquake, resulting in over 300 fatalities and significant damage in Mexico City and the surrounding region.\r\nFour people injured and at least 1,000 homes damaged in Oaxaca. Power outages occurred at Jamiltepec. In addition, a military helicopter surveying the damage crashed at Jamiltepec, killing 14 people on the ground and injuring 15 others. \r\n<p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>At least 1,000 homes were damaged in Oaxaca, the state&#39;s governor, Alejandro Murat, told a Mexican television program on Saturday, higher than earlier estimates of damage. A military helicopter surveying the quake damage crashed in Santiago Jamiltepec on Friday night, killing at least 13 people. Mexico&#39;s Interior Ministry said federal aid would go to towns including Pinotepa Nacional, closest to the epicenter, and Santiago Jamiltepec, which had reported 50 damaged homes along with a church and government building.

        "comments": "<b>Tectonic Summary</b><p>The Feb 25, 2018, M7.5 earthquake occurred as the result of thrust faulting at shallow a depth. Preliminary focal mechanism solutions indicate slip occurred on either a moderately dipping fault striking west-northwest, or on a moderately dipping fault striking southeast. At the location of this earthquake, the Australia plate is converging with the Pacific plate, moving towards the east-northeast with respect to Pacific lithosphere at a velocity of approximately 107 mm/yr. Earthquakes in this geographical region are generally associated with the large-scale convergence of these two major plates, and with the complex interactions of several associated microplates, most notably the South Bismarck plate, the Solomon Sea microplate, and the Woodlark plate. The location, depth, and focal mechanism solution of this earthquake are consistent with it occurring as intraplate faulting within the crust of the Australia plate. Papua New Guinea experiences a high rate of seismic activity, with 23 other events of M6&#43; occurring within 250 km of the Feb 25, 2018 earthquake over the preceding century. The closest of these was a M6.2 earthquake in August 1993, about 17km to the north of today&#39;s earthquake. The largest was a M7.2 event in June 1986, 230 km to the north-northeast on or near the Australia:Pacific plate boundary in the region. With the exception of a M7.5 earthquake at intermediate depth in eastern Papua New Guinea in Feb 1963, all prior M7.5&#43; earthquakes in this region have been associated with the shallow subduction zone plate boundaries in northern New Guinea. The vast majority of moderate-to-large earthquakes in this region are not known to have caused significant damage or casualties, though few have been as large as today&#39;s earthquake. \r\n</p><p>More than 125 people killed, 500 injured, 17,000 displaced and many homes destroyed or damaged in Hela, Southern Highlands and Western Provinces.

In the district of Lo Mustang in north-western Nepal, from where we have eyewitness counts, damage was very heavy. Monasteries and temples for the most part were destroyed; tens of thousands of &#34;sentient beings&#34; were killed, and trees and forests were extensively damaged. Many manor houses collapsed completely.

Shaking was also reported from the town of Agra on the southern edge of the Gangetic Plain. Prior to Sikander Lodi\u2019s move of his capital from Delhi to Agra, the city was of minor importance. Its fort at Badalgarh was damaged by the earthquake, and its reconstruction in 1505 (Lal 1980) was accompanied by expansion of the city to become a suitable residence for Sikander Lodi and his ministers and military leaders to administer his expanded dominions.</p>",

Focal mechanism solutions indicate that rupture occurred either on a steeply dipping fault striking to the northwest, or a moderately dipping fault striking to the northeast. At the location of the earthquake, the Australia plate moves to the north relative to the Pacific plate at a velocity of about 73 mm/yr. Earthquakes in this geographical region are generally associated with the large-scale convergence of these two major plates and with the complex interactions of several associated microplates, most notably the South Bismarck plate, the Solomon Sea microplate, and the Woodlark plate. The depth of the July 17th earthquake implies that it occurred in subducted or foundered lithosphere.\r\n</p><p>Although there is still not a complete geophysical consensus on the location and configuration of subducted plates in the region, the location of the earthquake is consistent with it occurring in a subducted fragment of the Australia plate (Solomon Sea microplate) that is bent about an approximately east-west axis and subducting both to the north and to the south or southwest. In northern Papua New Guinea, approximately 200 km to the north of the July 17th event, clear north-directed subduction of Australia beneath Pacific (and the South Bismarck microplate) occurs, with the associated Wadati-Benioff zone active to depths of more than 600 km beneath the Bismarck Sea to the northeast of New Guinea. The location of the July 17th earthquake places it in the gently south-southwest-dipping segment of the Solomon Sea microplate. Slip on a fault aligned with either nodal plane of the focal mechanism solution is consistent with this intraplate setting.\r\n</p><p>Papua New Guinea experiences a high rate of seismic activity, with 64 earthquakes occurring of M 6 and larger within 250 km of this event in the past 50 years, 8 of which were M7 or larger. Most of the previous seismicity has occurred to the north of this event. Recently, on May 7th, 2019, a M7.1 earthquake occurred 175 km to the northwest of this July 17th event at a depth of 146 km and destroyed at least 130 homes. A M7.4 earthquake on February 8th, 1987, 200km north of this event caused landslides that resulted in 3 fatalities. Earthquakes like the July 17th event, with focal depths between 70 and 300 km are commonly termed &#34;intermediate-depth&#34; earthquakes. Intermediate-depth earthquakes represent deformation within subducted slabs rather than at the shallow plate interface between subducting and overriding tectonic plates. They typically cause less damage on the ground surface above their foci than is the case with similar-magnitude shallow-focus earthquakes, but large intermediate-depth earthquakes may be felt at great distances from their epicenters.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12752:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>A woman died in a landslide and another was injured when her home collapsed as a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit parts of the country including Port Moresby on Friday, officials say.\r\n</p><p>Bosadi village elder Berry Donnea said a woman in her late 40s was also injured when her home collapsed on her during the tremor.\r\n</p><p>Donnea said 12 homes in three villages were damaged, and the nearby Bosapai River changed its course causing panic among the villagers.</p>",

The focal mechanism solution indicates that the earthquake occurred on a moderately dipping normal fault striking either eastward or westward. This mechanism indicates north-south oriented extension that is common in the Aegean Sea. Tectonics in the region surrounding this earthquake are relatively complex; to the south, Africa (Nubia) lithosphere subducts northward beneath the Eurasia plate at the Hellenic Trench; to the east, the Anatolian microplate (part of Eurasia) moves in a general westward direction, driving right-lateral faulting along its northern boundary, the North Anatolian Fault, and left-lateral faulting in southeast Turkey. The Aegean Sea region, western Turkey, and southern Greece where the October 30 earthquake occurred overall experiences north-south extension that is driven by southward migration of the Hellenic Trench.\r\n</p><p>In western Turkey and the Aegean Sea region, historic earthquakes demonstrate a mixture of transtensional and extensional faulting focal mechanism solutions. The October 30, 2020 earthquake produced nearly pure normal faulting, and is broadly consistent with past earthquakes in the region. The location of the October 30, 2020 event is about 250 km north of the closest main plate boundary, where the Africa plate moves to the north at a rate of approximately 10 mm/yr with respect to Eurasia; this earthquake is thus considered an intraplate event. While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as slip over a larger fault area. M7 normal faulting events typically have a fault area of 50 x 20 km.\r\n</p><p>The Aegean Sea frequently experiences moderate to large earthquakes, and the region within 250 km of the October 30, 2020 earthquake has hosted 29 other M 6&#43; events over the preceding 100 years. The largest instrumentally documented earthquake in the region was a M 7.7 earthquake in July 1956 between the islands of Naxos and Santorini (Thera), and southwest of the October 30, 2020 earthquake. The 1956 earthquake was the largest earthquake of the 20th century in Greece. As a result of this 1956 event, a M 7.2 aftershock occurred 13 minutes later with an accompanying large tsunami, 53 fatalities, 100 injuries, and extensive damage in Amorgos and nearby Santorini. More recently, on July 20 2017 a M 6.6 earthquake occurred southeast of the October 30, 2020 event near Bodrum, Turkey, and resulted in 2 fatalities and hundreds of injuries reported in Greece and Turkey.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #12798, 12801, 12803, 12804, 12805, 12810:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>114 people killed in Turkey.

Focal mechanism solutions for the earthquake indicate rupture occurred on either a shallowly dipping oblique reverse strike-slip fault striking towards the northwest or on a steeply dipping reverse fault striking towards the south, both of which indicate roughly east-west oriented compression. Eastern Indonesia is characterized by complex tectonics in which motions of numerous small microplates are accommodating large-scale convergence between the Australia, Sunda, Pacific, and Philippine Sea plates.

        "comments": "<p><i>Ref #1053:</i><br /><strong>Tectonic Summary</strong><br />The February 13, 2021, M 7.1 earthquake near the east coast of Honshu, Japan, occurred as the result of thrust faulting near the subduction zone interface plate boundary between the Pacific and North America plates. Moment tensor solutions indicate that slip occurred either on a moderately dipping fault striking to the south, or a moderately dipping fault striking to the north-northeast, consistent with the east-west oriented compression expected in this region. At the location of this earthquake, the Pacific plate moves approximately westward relative to the North America plate at a velocity of 70 mm/yr, subducting beneath Japan at the Japan Trench and dipping to the west beneath Japan. Note that some researchers divide this region into several microplates that together define the relative motions among the larger Pacific, North America, and Eurasia plates; these include the Okhotsk and Amur microplates local to this earthquake that are part of North America and Eurasia, respectively.<br />While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as slip over a larger fault area. Reverse (thrust) faulting events of the size of the February 13, 2021 earthquake are typically about 45 km long by 25 km wide in size.<br />The February 13 earthquake occurred in the vicinity of the rupture area of the March 11, 2011 M9.1 Tohoku earthquake. The March 2011 M9.1 earthquake was widely felt on the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido in Japan. Notably, that earthquake generated a significant tsunami that led to extensive destruction along the Japanese coast and propagated throughout the Pacific Ocean basin. Approximately 16,000 people perished as a result of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The February 13 earthquake epicenter was located ~75 km from the epicenter of the March 2011 earthquake. In the past century, 33 earthquakes of M7 or greater have occurred within 250 km of the February 13 earthquake, including 6 earthquakes &gt;M7 since the March 2011 M9.1 earthquake.</p><p><i>Ref #12856:</i><br />The quake damaged about 1,400 houses in Fukushima, according to the prefectural government. In Miyagi, 186 houses were partially destroyed, the internal affairs ministry said.<br />The powerful earthquake injured nearly 160 people, according to the ministry. The temblor also caused damage to school buildings in Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures, prompting a total of 82 schools to close on Monday.<br />A total of 324 cases of damage to school buildings had been discovered in four prefectures, including 121 in Miyagi and 192 in Fukushima, including cracked walls and floors, shattered windows, and burst water pipes, according to the education ministry. Although no deaths were attributed to the temblor that struck at 11:07 p.m. Saturday, it caused power and water outages across a wide area.</p><p><i>Ref #12863</i>:<br />The Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA) preliminary report on February 19 claimed that the earthquake caused injuries to at least 185 people across nine prefectures with 12 people suffering serious injuries. Reports indicate at least 100 people injured in Fukushima Prefecture and 63 in Miyagi Prefecture, with 30 in Sendai city. Reports indicate at least 2,649 residential structures damaged in Miyagi and Fukushima Prefectures with the majority of damage occurring in the towns of Shinchi and Kagamiishi.</p><p><i>Ref #12946</i>:<br />When it struck, this offshore quake left one person dead and injured more than 186, while causing significant structural damage across the Tohoku and Kanto regions of Japan. Japan\u2019s Fire and Disaster Management Agency explained that over 9,137 buildings were damaged in the earthquake, many severely, which has driven an escalating insured loss total.</p>",

The shock was felt over a large area and had social repercussions. \r\n<p>In Nicomedia churches, public buildings, the hippodrome and the docks were destroyed and houses were carried down the slopes oft he hills on which Nicomedea was built, killing most of the people; amongst others, the vice-governor, the bishop Cecropius and a bishop from the Bosphorus, and according to others, 15 other bishops, who had arrived before the rest, shattering the church. The upper part of the city seems to have suffered less; Arsacius was found dead in an unshaken citadel tower, which was not destroyed.\r\n</p><p>The greater part of the temples and private houses, and of the population as well, might have been saved, had not a conflagration burned for five days after the earthquake. Those who survived fled into the country.\r\n</p><p>It was reported that Nicaea, Perinthus and Constantinople had been destroyed, but this report cannot be true. Nicaea (Iznik) must have suffered less because transferring the synod to that city was considered, but the proposal was abandoned on account of the situation created by the earthquake in the province of Bithynia.\r\n</p><p>Constantinople suffered some damage, but apart from the church of the Apostales (later Fatih camii; Muler-Wiener 1977, 405) it is not known what else was damaged. Perinthus (modern Marmaraerglisi) and many other towns were damaged, but details are lacking. In addition another 150 towns in Bithynia, the names of which are not given, were partly damaged, the shocks triggering landslides and ground deformation in the region of Nicomedea.\r\n</p><p><b><i>The flooding by the sea of the lower parts of Nicomedea was probably the result of the tempest, rather than a seismic sea wave. There is no mention of sea waves elsewhere.</i></b><i> The shock caused concern and probably triggered landslides as far as Macedonia (east Thrace) and the district of Pontus in Asia Minor, but again details are lacking. Nicomedea was restored with the help of the Emperor, who rebuilt public buildings, theatres, churches, colonnades and the harbour, as well as the church of Anthimus. \r\n<p>An oration was composed on the occasion, and the event is mentioned by almost all near-contemporary writers. However, it appears that the effects of the earthquake were less catastrophic than individual reports seem to indicate. Far more was rumored to have happened to those at a distance than had actually happened, and both pagan and ecclesiastical writers seem to exaggerate the destruction, attributing it to the wrath of their gods.</p><p>Impressively many sources survive for this earthquake: the effects on Nicomedea were of intense interest to near-contemporary ecclesiastical historians, insofar as the earthquake prevented a synod from being held in Nicomedea. This was at the time of the Arian dispute, and the Nicomedea Synod was intended as an orthodox rival to the Arian synod held in Arinium. <b><i>Predictably the Arian writer Philostorgius sees the earthquake as suppressing an impious synod, and talks about the inundation of Nicomedea by a sea wave, while the orthodox writer Sozomen attemps to show that the accounts of the destruction of Nicomedea were exaggerated</i></b>. By way of mitigation he points out that Nicaea, Perinthus and Constantinople were also affected, and that the citadel tower of Nicomedea survived.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #9116)\r\n</p><p>358, August 24.

Lima, for the most part, was destroyed, the towers of the cathedral collapsed. Several strong shocks were recorded. Frightened by the ominous rumbles which preceded the shocks, the inhabitants ran from their houses. But not everyone got out in time, for <b>14 to 22 persons perished</b> under the wreckage of the houses. Callao, Chancau, Ica, and possibly Cusco and Trujillo were substantially damaged. In Callao, the sea level fell by 14m after the earthquake and then rose 24m, inundating the land for a distance of 250m, destroying everything in its path and washing the dikes away. (ref #415) <p>9 July 19:00. Earthquake which razed much of the city of Lima and knocked down the towers of the Cathedral; only between 14-22 persons died, as the destruction was preceded by a loud noise which warned the population to get out into the streets, plazas, and gardens. Slides of large rocks and stones from the San Cristobal hill and others situated in the high part of the valley. Fissures formed in the ground. In El Callao the sea rose two fathoms and advanced about three hundred paces, inundating part of the town and destroying everything in its path. The seismic movement extended some 1000km along the coast, from Trujillo to Caraveli, and some 120km inland, according to the report of the Viceroy Don Fernando Torres y Portugal, Count of Villar. It was destructive in the village of Valverde. It was felt in Huanuco and Cuzco. The Viceroy wrote to his majesty: &#34;Wednesday July 9th, eighth day of the visitation of Our Lady of this year 1586, dawned very clear and was quiet until nearly night, which was much disturbed when it became very dark, and between 7-8 o&#39;clock the ground slowly began to tremble in this city of Lima and the port of El Callao; it was thus for the time it took to recite one Credo, and after three others or a little more, and according to the Spanish and natives it was greater than those of the years 1555, 1581, and 1584 which they say were the greatest that had been seen up to that time, altogether they did not do as much damage as this one, and in its effects it seemed that, although those [shocks] damaged many houses of this city and harbor, they toppled few, whereas in this one there was no church, monastery, hospital, or house that was not left partly or wholly collapsed or ruined and the Royal Houses of Your Majesty in this city and in El callao were particularly affected by earthquake, because the House in El Callao, which had already been damaged due to the shock of &#39;84, was now completely demolished.(ref #1111)\r\n</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><br /><b><h2>Reports of Epicenters, Magnitudes and Effects</h2></b>\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td>\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Date</b></td><td><b>Lat</b></td><td><b>Long</b></td><td><b>Depth (km)</b></td><td align=\"center\"><b>Magnitude</b></td><td align=\"center\"><b>Intensity</b></td><td align=\"center\"><b>Reference #</b></td></tr><tr><td>July 10, 1586 00:30 UTC</td><td>12.3S</td><td>77.7W</td><td align=\"center\">60</td><td align=\"center\">7.7</td><td align=\"center\">10</td><td align=\"center\">1208</td></tr><tr><td>July 10, 1586 00:30 UTC</td><td>12.1S</td><td>77.0W</td><td align=\"center\">40</td><td align=\"center\">8.6</td><td align=\"center\">9</td><td align=\"center\">1221</td></tr><tr><td>July 10, 1586 00:30 UTC</td><td>12S</td><td>77W</td><td></td><td align=\"center\">8.5</td><td></td><td align=\"center\">150</td></tr><tr><td>July 9, 1586</td><td>12.2S</td><td>77.7W</td><td></td><td align=\"center\">8.5</td><td></td><td align=\"center\">552</td></tr><tr><td>July 9, 1586 (19:00 Local Time)</td><td>12S</td><td>77W</td><td></td><td align=\"center\">8.5</td><td></td><td align=\"center\">415</td></tr><tr><td>July 9, 1586</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align=\"center\">8.1</td><td></td><td align=\"center\">11967</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>",

There was an earthquake on the Philippine Islands. &#34;No stone was left on stone&#34; from Manila to the north coast of Luzon Island. In the capital, only 2 of 12 churches remained standing, while the rest were left in ruins. Other stone buildings also collapsed. The <b>number of dead surpassed 600 and there were 2500 injured</b>. From the provinces of Cagayan and Northern Ilocos, situated on the extreme north, changes in relief were reported: the course of rivers changed, loose ground settled, sand was ejected from cracks or gryphoons, and new springs appeared. One could not remain standing. The earthquake was also destructive on Mindoro I, Marinduque I and some other islands to the south of Luzon I. The provinces of Camarines and Albay in the southeastern part of Luzon Island did not suffer or suffered very little. Numerous subsequent shocks were felt until the end of 1646; the strongest of them occurred on December 5 at 23:00 [Local Time]. During the earthquake (or the strongest aftershock), &#34;the succession and movement of waves on the river at Manila was so enormous that it seemed the water would submerge all the land. The fury of the waves made the river leave its banks, and its water was thrown over the top of the bridge&#34; (Repetti, 1946). [The hypothesis by Iida, Cox and others (Iida et al, 1967; Cox, 1970), that this agitation was caused not by a tsunami but by seiches in Manila Bay is plausible.]</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1187:</i></blockquote> <p>1645, Nov 30, 8:00 p.m. Manila and its vicinity.

It was so great an earthquake in this city that it ruined most of the buildings. As these were of stone, many persons among the natives and slaves were killed.

The most terrible earthquake recorded in the annals of-the Archipelago.It might also be said that from Manila to Cagayanand Ilocos Nirte it left no stone upon the other. In the capital, where during the preceding fifty rears a great number of stone buildings hac1 been erected, magnificent churches, palaces, and public buildings, as well as private residences and villas, the destruction was frightful. Ten churches were wrecked entirely... only San Agustin and the Jesuit Church remained standing. Twelve monasteries, colleges, and hospitals were likewise converted into ruins. No better fared the palace of the Governor-General, the Real Audiencia and up to 150 of the finest residences which, as one author puts it, &#34;in other cities would have been considered palaces.&#34; The rest of the private houses were damaged to so great an extent that the majority had to be demolished. The number of persons killed exceeded 600 and the total of killed and injured is stated to have been 3000. Outside of Manila there was a general destruction of villas and other buildings which had been erected on both banks of the Pasig River. Throughout the neighboring provinces the masonry structures built by the missionaries suffered the same fate as those in Manila. From the farthest provinces in the north were reported great alterations of the surface with almost complete disappearance of some native villages, changes in the courses of rivers, subsidence of plains, eruptions of sand, etc... </p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1055:</i></blockquote> <p>1645, Nov 30, 12h GMT.

Many residents of Manila, frightened by the continuing shocks, left the city and lived in temporary huts and tents. The earthquake was accompanied by a hurricane, which tore the roofs off the huts and ran six ships onshore (according to other sources, sank) in Manila Harbor. In one of the sources, the shipwrecks are not\r\nassociated with the hurricane, but only with the earthquake (Perrey, 1860 b; Maso, 1910 a, 1926; Repetti, 1946). </p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1187:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1824, October 26.

In this quake, the walls of all buildings cracked within a few seconds and many roofs collapsed. Walls of a thickness of 2 m developed cracks from top to bottom. About <b>30 people died</b>. The strongest shocks lasted for half a minute (70 seconds, according to other sources).\r\n<p>In Callao, the earthquake occurred somewhat later than in Lima, since the cloud of dust could be seen rising over the ruins of Lima before the shocks were felt. Almost all houses in the town were damaged. Chorillos and Chancay were also seriously damaged.\r\n</p><p>Apparently, the earthquake was felt throughout Peru. Several villages were destroyed along the coast north of Lima. In the area of Huarochiri, an entire village slid down the side of a hill in a landslide. Rockfalls had occurred in many sections of the road from San Mateo to Lima. In Surras, subterranean water forced its way to the surface. Trujillo and Huanuco experienced strong shocks but there was no damage. In Arequipa, the shocks were weak, and in Arica, the earthquake was not felt at all. Weak secondary tremors were felt in Lima for a week after the earthquake.\r\n</p><p>A strong sea quake was felt on vessels lying at anchor in Callao. These disturbances were accompanied by rumbling sounds resembling distant thunder. The water began to churn, bubbles of hydrogen sulphide rose from the bottom and many dead fish surfaced. The surface of the ocean, which previous to the earthquake was like glass, became agitated and the water became muddy. The vessel &#34;Volant&#34; rocked 35 cm [degrees?] to either side from its position of equilibrium.\r\n</p><p>In Trujillo, the earthquake was followed by pouring rain. In Lambayeque and Chiclajo, the rainfall was even heavier and continued for four days without a break. These towns were reduced to a heap of ruins, particularly the first of them, where the river overflowed and razed the\r\nwhole town to the ground, with the exception of three streets. Farms were laid waste and crops damaged. Piura was destroyed in a similar manner. In the Sechura Desert - an area that never gets a drop of water - the heavy rain brought a stream into being (Mallet, 1853; Perrey, 1854 b;\r\nPolo, 1899 a; Silgado, 1968). Sieberg (Sieberg, 1929, 1932) mistakenly assumed that the coastal cities to the north of Lima were destroyed by tsunami waves.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)\r\n</p><p>March 30, 1828, 12:35 UTC, 12.13 S, 77.8 W08 W, depth 50 km, intensity VII, casualties.

The strong earthquake with its focus in the Algeria - Provence basin of the Mediterranean sea apparently occurred near the north - eastern coast of Algeria.<br />The earthquake covered the shore of the province of Constantine from Bougie to Bone. The strength of shocks was estimated as follows (from east to west). Not many citizens of La Calle noticed them. Quite appreciable shocks were in the region of Guelma, strong shocks were in Annaba (Bone) and Skikda. The earthquake was felt in Stora, and it was felt very strongly in Jijel. Sounds like explosions were heard in Bougie accompanied by strong shocks. Shocks were felt in Setif and Algiers. Weak tremors were in Batna. Strong shocks were felt on a ship sailing 15 miles from Jijel while the sea was calm and the weather was windless; measuring the sea depth with a plummet revealed no sand- bank. Two wavy shocks 3 s long were felt on the southwestern shore of the Island of Sardinia in Carloforte. The first shock was preceded by a hollow rumble and caused a variety of pottery to fall in houses, but it caused no serious damage. The second shock resulted in the bells ringing. These two shocks were also felt on fishermen&#39;s boats on the roadstead. The shocks in Iglesias and S. Pietro were not so strong.<br />The earthquake was felt on the Islands of Mallorca and Malta.

There was an earthquake with a maximal intensity of 9 degrees (X Rossi-Forel) on the south of Mindanao Island, in the provinces of Lanao and Cotabato. Its source was situated in the northern part of Illana Bay. Heavy losses were inflicted on all the buildings in the cities, to the fortresses as well as the settlements of the Moro tribe, situated in the pleistoseismic zone. Unusual effects were observed on land as well as in the bay. In particular, the underwater telegraph, cable in the bay was cut and washed out. There were rather reliable reports about <b>numerous victims</b> at the fortifications of the Moro tribe, but the exact number is unknown. The zone of perceptibility included the islands in the Visayan Sea and measured 700 x 680 km. An underground rumble was heard for an enormous distance. There were so many recurrent shocks that about 400 were counted in only the first eight days after the catastrophe, and 10-12 of them reached 5-6 degrees (VI-VII). The main earthquake was registered by European seismic stations. Sieberg, in relating this information, adds that a tsunami occurred. There is thus no reliable information about a tsunami, although one cannot entirely eliminate the possibility. (reference #414)\r\n<p>1902, August 21, 19:17 [local time], Intensity X.

The effects were extraordinary on land as well as within the bay; in the latter the telegraph cables were found broken and buried by debris. It is assumed as certain that there were <b>many lives lost</b> in the Moro forts, but their number is not known.

There was a very strong earthquake in the southern part of Atacama province, with a zone of destruction approximately from Copiapo to Coquimbo. It was felt from Iquique to Concepcion (according to other sources, from Antofagasta to Valdivia) and from Buenos Aires to San Felix Island (where volcanic activity may have intensified). The underwater cables broke near shore at depths of 100 and 2200 m. The instrumental and macroseismic epicenters were fixed at sea in the region of Vallenar - Huasco. This tsunami generating earthquake began with relatively weak, but comparatively rapidly intensifying oscillations, lasting from 1/2 to 8 minutes according to different estimates. The chief of the seismic station of Copiapo described the earthquake as follows:\r\n<p>A terrible roar was heard, like loud peals of thunder, which awakened all those who were asleep. At the same time, ground oscillations began with an intensity of 4-5 degrees (V according to Rossi Forel), intensifying in 20 seconds to 7 degrees (VIII). The tremors then reached their maximal intensity and continued, without abating, for another 3 minutes, then gradually began to die down. According to other sources, the earthquake began with abrupt vertical shocks; essentially, it consisted of two independent tremors.\r\n</p><p>At Copiapo and other places, it was mainly flimsy structures (pise homes) on loose soils which suffered damage. <b>More than 500 people died.</b> Luminous discharges in the atmosphere were observed at many places. It is possible that a slight elevation of the coast took place in the Chanaral region. \r\n</p><p>The earthquake was preceded by strong foreshocks, felt on the 3rd and 7th of November. Seismic activity in the focal zone of the earthquake was high for two months.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)\r\n</p><p>The magnitude of the main shock was 8.4, according to Richter.

This destructive\r\nearthquake caused property damage estimated at $8\r\nmillion and killed 13 people. Most of the damage occurred at Santa Barbara and nearby towns along the coast, but the earthquake caused moderate damage at many points north of the Santa Ynez Mountains, in the Santa Ynez and Santa Maria River valleys. North of Santa Barbara, the earth dam of\r\nthe Sheffield Reservoir was destroyed, but the water\r\nreleased caused little damage.\r\n<p>In Santa Barbara, few buildings on State Street escaped damage. Because parts of the main business district and the area near the seashore were built on land fill, many of the structures there were demolished, and others were so shattered that they had to be razed. In general, however, buildings of reinforced concrete were damaged little, [except where workmanship was poor; frame buildings covered with stucco, sheathing, or lath also withstood the shock\r\nwell. Loss to the sewage system was heavy only in areas of land fill, but the disposal plant was destroyed above the surface of the ground.\r\n</p><p>Among the most conspicuous building failures in Santa Barbara were the Arlington Hotel (a composite building of irregular shape), the Californian Hotel (a new four-story brick building), the San Marcos office building (a four-story reinforced concrete structure), the El Camino Real Hotel (a two-story brick and wood structure), and the Potter Theater building (a three-and-one-third-story brick and wood structure). Other public buildings seriously damaged included the courthouse, jail, library, schools, and churches.\r\n</p><p>Structures built on solid ground or pavement of all\r\ntypes withstood the earthquake well. The only severely damaged pavement was that on the boulevard paralleling the beach, where the shoulders of the pavement were displaced 20-36 cm horizontally. The pavement sustained cracks as wide as 40 cm at several points along the beachfront. Concrete curbs buckled in almost every block in Santa Barbara.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake caused damage on the Southern Pacific Company Railroad from Gaviota (mile 331 as measured from San Francisco) on the north to Ventura (mile 598) on the south. Heavy subsidence of the larger fills and slope failure of the sides of deep cuts were noted on the railroad track from Naples to Santa Barbara. Many of the bluffs in the Naples area, adjacent to the ocean, fissured and caused extensive landslides. A section of ground (about 2 acres), adjacent to the track between Naples and\r\nSanta Barbara, subsided about 30 cm.\r\n</p><p>Felt from Paso Robles (San Luis Obispo County) on the north to Santa Ana (Orange County) on the south and to Mojave (Kern County) on the east.

Strongly felt, with moderate damage, at a number of points in the Santa Ynez and Santa Maria Valleys, with a number of strong aftershocks on July 3.

Epicentre occupied a belt aligned WNW-ESE and running for some 8O miles from east of Motihari through Sitamarhi to Madhurai. Origin attributed by D. N. Wadia, J. A. Dunn, J. B. Auden and A. M. N. Ghosh to movement along a fault or series of faults below the alluvium. (reference #1095)\r\n<p>January 15, 1934. Seismograms at stations in India as well as in all distant parts of the world made it possible to locate the epicenter and to fix the magnitude at 8.4. The extent of the isoseismals places this earthquake only a little below that of 1897. Intensity X on the Mercalli scale was assigned to a belt about 80 miles long by 20 miles wide, and to two spots almost 100 miles distant from the main belt, at Monghyr to the south and in the Nepal\r\nValley to the north. The isoseismal of intensity IX was drawn to include an area which the authors of the report name &#34;the slump belt,&#34; about 190 miles long and of irregular width exceeding 40 miles in places. The main belt\r\nof intensity X lies entirely within the slump belt. (reference #1006)\r\n</p><p>January 15, 1934, India: Bihar-Nepal, magnitude 8.4 Ms, 10,700 deaths.

The material damage has been estimated at 3.6 million sols. It was felt all over Peru and beyond to Guayaquil in the north and Arica in the south. \r\n<p>The tremors were strongest in the littoral zone to the north of Lima. There were many slides of loose material and rock falls on the western slopes of the Cordilleras. The settlements situated on alluvial soils on the terraces of the Chancay River (Canchapille was laid waste) and the Huaura River (Huascoy and Jumbilka were almost completely\r\ndestroyed), suffered most of all. Many buildings in Chancay (in particular, two churches collapsed), Huacho, Barranca, Lima, Callao, Chorrillos and Lurin were destroyed. It was mainly flimsy and dilapidated buildings which suffered. According to estimates, 38% of reed panel homes, 23% of adobe homes, 20% of brick homes, 9% of reinforced concrete buildings and 10% of buildings made of other materials were\r\ndestroyed in the pleistoseismic zone. The intensity of tremors at Lima was 7-8 degrees. \r\n</p><p>The following was reported from other places. The earthquake was weaker at Chosica than at Lima [7 degrees]. Homes sank to one side at Cajatambo [7]. At Huamey, Caiiete, Chincha and Pisco, there was moderate destruction, and there were strong tremors at Paramonga [6-7]. There was some damage at Yauyos and Huaitara, [6-7]; the earthquake was milder at Huancavelika, Pampas and Lircay [6]. There was a strong earthquake at Huancayo [5-6]. The earthquake was noticed at Satipo and Ojapampa. It was not strong at Santo Tomas and was accompanied by rumbling [4-5]. It was strong at Chachapoyas, Cajamarca, Chota and Mollendo [4-5]. At Cotahuasi, Cuzco and Puno it was felt with some intensity\r\n[4-5]. It was light at Tayabamba [4]. It was also light at Moyobamba and Tarapoto [3-4]; not everyone noticed it at Arequipa [3-4]; there were long period oscillations at Guayaquil [3]. \r\n</p><p>Apparently, oscillations in the sea level developed. According to the Chief of the Hydrographic Service in Peru, E. Zimich, they were stronger [in the Huaura-Chankay region?] than those of 17.X.1966. \r\n</p><p>The source of the earthquake was located under the earth&#39;s crust. There were no aftershocks, or in any case, no strong ones.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)\r\n</p><p>Reference #1208 lists intensity X.\r\n</p><p>Reference #552 lists magnitude 8.4</p>",

Heavy landslides occurred to the northwest of Illapel, blocking roads, in particular, the coastal highway and the highway from Illapel to the sea. A rock dump collapsed at the Kosinera mine near Ovalle. <b>Five miners were killed</b>. In all, <b>11 people died as a result of the earthquake</b>. A building of the Ministry of Defense was damaged at Santiago. The earthquake was strong at La Serena. It was felt as far as Iquique, Valdivia and Buenos Aires, where crockery was broken in some high buildings and the ink spilled from inkwells. There were many aftershocks, some strong.

Illapel earthquake. This great earthquake destroyed most of the towns of Combarbala, Ovalle and Illapel, about 200 km north of Santiago. There was damage in a wide region, including Santiago. Curiously, there is an almost complete lack of references to this earthquake. The epicentral area is mountainous, sparsely inhabited and of minor economic importance. In addition, its occurrence in the middle of the day must have contributed to its being forgotten. There are no references in the technical literature. An unpublished isoseismal map by Greve shows an extension of the region of damage similar to the 1939 Chillan earthquake. The shock was felt as far as Buenos Aires, where dishes were broken and ink spilled from inkwells in some of the taller buildings. Northwest of Illapel, toward the coast, there were large landslides and the roads were blocked, particularly on the coastal highway and the road from Illapel to the coast. A minor tsunami caused damage to fishing vessels in Los Vilos. Damage extended throughout the Province of Coquimbo. A tailings dam collapsed at the mine &#34;Cocinera&#34;, near Ovalle, killing five. The total number of dead was 11. The only conspicuous damage in Santiago was pounding damage along an expansion joint near the west entrance of the Ministry of Defense, Plaza Bulnes. This damage recurs at every important earthquake in Santiago, and is still visible essentially as in 1943. The computed epicenter is offshore, opposite the mouth of the Limari River. The magnitude was 8.3 and the focal depth was around 60 km. There were many strong aftershocks during the following week, some of which caused additional damage in weakened houses throughout the area. (reference #252)\r\n</p><p>1943, April 6.

In the pleistoseismic zone, the ground cracked and sand and water smelling of hydrogen sulfide was ejected from the cracks. It was mainly the old churches, which had been built in the 17th and 18th centuries, which had been damaged during the war [Second World War], which suffered.

One hundred and ten people died and 3000 were injured; damage amounted to 35 million dollars. The area of damage had a length of about 400 km and a width of less than 50 km. The port city of Huacho, the nearby villages of Huaura and San Nicolas (3 km south of Supe) and also the village of Puente Piedra, situated in a swamp (a filled in lake) in the vicinity of Lima, suffered especially.

Several\r\nmosques and ancient monuments were destroyed. It is worth noting that none of the 35 reinforced-concrete buildings in the town were damaged beyond repair. As at Akcaalan and in other villages, damage was aggravated by the fires which started after the main shock and during the aftershocks, due to electrical short-circuits or to the overturning of oil lamps or cooking stoves. The heaviest damage occurred in the two valleys with neogene sedimentary fill running north-west and north of Gediz. The macroseismic epicentre\r\n(according to the observatory at Kandilli) was situated at 39 deg 07 min N., 29 deg 23 min E., that is to say at about 10 km north-west of Gediz.

The source region of the earthquake was not densely populated. Due to the inaccessibility of the location, little information was received from the area. In all, <b>56 people died and a few\r\nhundred were injured</b>. The cities of Tecoman and Coahuayana sustained the most severe damage. In Manzanillo, the earthquake injured livestock and damaged roads. Several houses collapsed in the cities of Colima and Ciudad Guzman. In other cities, damage was limited to cracks and falling plaster in houses. Many landslides and ground cracks were discovered over a large but sparsely populated area on the coast of Michoacan. In Mexico City, strong ground tremors continued for about 40 seconds. Motor vehicle traffic was\r\ndisrupted on major roads. Damage to windows and decorations on building fronts could be seen, mainly in high-rise buildings located in the commercial area of Mexico City. Strong ground tremors occurred, most of which lasted for\r\nperiods of 2 seconds. A weak tsunami with a maximum height of 1 m was observed. (Ref #417)\r\n<p>17 killed, 390 reported injured. (Ref #1053)\r\n</p><p>30 casualties. (Ref #369)</p>",

The area of severest shaking (Modified Mercalli Intensity X) was bounded by San Angelo del Lombardi, Calitri, Pescopagano and Calabritto. The shock caused damage as far east as Potenza, north to near Ariano Irpino, Avellino and Nappoli, and south to Capaccio. \r\n<p>There were three main shocks, each with epicenters in a different place, within 80 seconds. The largest shock registered a peak acceleration of 0.38g with 10 seconds of motion greater than 0.1g. The three main shocks combined produced 70 seconds of shaking greater than 0.01g.

The volcano&#39;s topography and volcanic deposits contributed to the disaster, but the primary area of landslides lay S of the main volcanic edifice and reached a maximum elevation of ~3,000 m. Aerial observers on 7 July saw no changes in either the vigor of fumaroles present near the summit or in the distribution and surface appearance of glaciers. Though dislodged ice was noted in news reports, none was found during fieldwork. The latest estimates on direct human impact from the earthquake are &gt;150 fatalities, 500 people listed as missing, and 20,000 people displaced. Six bridges and &gt;100 km of roads were destroyed.

The earthquake was the strongest in modern times along the DST and possessed a clear left-lateral motion (e.g., Salamon et al., 2003; Baer et al., 2008, and references therein). The earthquake struck at 06:18 in the morning (local time), damaged nearby settlements, and resulted in at least 11 casualties and 47 injuries. It was felt as far as \u223c600 km around the Gulf (Al-Tarazi, 2000). The mainshock epicenter was located between Nuweiba and Dahab (Fig. 1; Table 1), along the Aragonese segment of the DST, at an approximate depth of 15 km (Baer et al., 2008), and was followed by an intense sequence of felt aftershocks (e.g., Hofstetter et al., 2003).

On the Batu Islands, it was preceded and accompanied by an underground roar and caused more serious effects than the main earthquake. The shock was rather strong at Airbangis and very perceptible at Padang. The earthquake was accompanied by a tsunami, which reached its greatest intensity on Simuk Island, that is, on the western tip of the archipelago. Before the catastrophe, there were 120 homes on this island in the villages and temporary settlements, and about 1000 people lived there. Ninety-six homes were destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami; about 3/4 of the population perished. (reference #414)\r\n<p>1861, March 9. Sumatra, Padang, Islands of Batu, Simo.

The hospital clock stopped during this second shock which was equally violent at Bougie, Constantine and Setif but less strong at Djebel El Ouahch near Constantine [...] The 22 August 1856 tremor caused the <strong>loss of eight lives</strong> and severely injured several among the population of Djidjelli; four people have been buried in the rubble.</p><p><i>Ref #2130</i>:<br />Aug 22,1856, 11h40m, Sea of Alboran, Algeria, intensity IX. An earthquake occurred at the same place as the preceding one, but it was stronger. All houses of the citizens of Jijel collapsed, and several people (3 or 5) who remained in the town were killed. The firmer houses, constructed by the French army, survived, but suffered damage of varying degree. Two long fissures oriented along the shore and crossing the town were formed in the ground. The coast sank by 10-15 cm and collapsed into the water in some places. The area of heavy damage included mountain settlements far away from the shore. According to fragmentary data, the area of collapses included the districts of Ouled Abdallakh and Beni Ider. Even light huts were thrown onto the earth in Djebel Khaddida and Betaissa; rockfalls occurred in many places.<br />The shocks were also severe in the area to the south of Jijel. Fissures appeared in the edges of the valley of the Oued Missia. The area of destruction spread up to Bou Saada.<br />The liquefaction of soil was observed on the low-lying parts of the valley of Chekfa to the southeast of Jijel, in particular, within the region of Beni Ider and also occurred in the low land between the Oued Safsaf River and Djebel El Khalia where many mud volcanoes originated, that erupted water for many minutes after the earthquake.<br />Mosques, barracks and 49 houses of the 75 in Collo in the eastern direction were destroyed. Less serious damage was done to the district of Philippeville, where there were no victims. Almost all the houses in Stora, and in a lesser degree in Gastonville, underwent strong shocks; several recently constructed buildings in Robertville were seriously damaged. Some old houses cracked in Conde Smendou. The damage in Philippeville was not great and resulted in partial destruction of the top of the minaret and of the belltower, in a number of buildings cracking, in chimneys falling onto roofs and so on. Various effects were observed far away from the focal zone. Long-period low velocity oscillations lasted 30 s in Bougie; some slight damage was done to the houses built of adobe; water-saturated ground was displaced in some places. Several local buildings cracked in Setif. Tremors of lesser strength were observed in Batna (150 km south-southeast of Jijel). Fissures formed in several old houses of Constantine. Several old houses of adobe cracked badly in the low-lying regions of Bene, several stoves tumbled down, and the clock on the building of a hospital started ringing.<br />The earthquake was felt in Collo 240 km east of Jijel, but it was not noticed farther than Souk Ahras. It was felt 240km to the west, up to the town of Algiers.<br />The earthquake was felt in Cagliari on Sardinia Is., in Carloforte on S. Pietro Is. where the parish clock rang. It was weaker than the preceding one in Mahon, stronger in Nice, it was felt in Genoa, and, possibly in Geneva.<br />Aftershocks continued for a year.

Eastern Indonesia is characterized by complex tectonics in which motions of numerous small plates are accommodating large-scale convergence between the Australia and Eurasia plates. At the location of today&#39;s earthquake, the Celebes Sea basin (commonly considered part of the Sunda plate) moves south with respect to the Minahassa peninsula (part of the Molucca Sea plate) at a velocity of about 30 mm/year. The lithosphere of the Celebes Sea basin is thrust beneath that of the Minahassa peninsula and is seismically active to a depth of about 250 km.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake occurred approximately 25 km off the northern coast of the Minahassa peninsula of the Island of Sulawesi in an area that has seen large earthquakes in the past. For example, a damaging magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred on April 18, 1990 approximately 85 km east of today&#39;s earthquake. The magnitude 7.6 earthquake in 1990 was followed a year later by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in approximately the same place. More recently a magnitude 7.0 occurred within 45 km of today&#39;s earthquake on November 25, 1997. The 1997 earthquake caused damage to at least 90 building in the Gorontalo area of northern Sulawesi. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>Authorities said thousands of houses were damaged and at least one school collapsed in rural towns in central Sulawesi. Several aftershocks followed, sending villagers fleeing into the streets, fearing a possible tsunami.\r\nAt least one hospital was evacuated and more than 12 hours after the initial shock, residents remained outdoors on high ground, according to Indonesia&#39;s state news agency.

Today&#39;s earthquake appears to have been larger than the M 6.9 earthquake in 1940 or any of the early 20th century events (e.g., 1915 and 1934) in this region of northern Baja California.

Jesus (hay-SOOS&#39;) Serrano said.\r\nSunday&#39;s quake centered just south of the U.S. border near Mexicali killed two people in Mexico and injured at least 100, including someone who was hit in the head by a sign at a carwash in the California town of El Centro. The initial earthquake downed three power lines, a gas leak forced a brief evacuation of about 30 homes, and residents were removed from a senior living center built in the early 1900s. Electricity was out for hours in the city&#39;s southeast area. The U.S damage appeared to be limited to California&#39;s southeastern Imperial Valley in what was one of the strongest earthquakes to hit the region in decades.

On a broad scale, the seismtectonics of the region near the October 23, 2011 earthquake are controlled by the collision of the Arabian Plate and Eurasian plates; at the latitude of this event, the Arabian plate converges with Eurasia in a northerly direction at a rate of approximately 24 mm/yr. West of the October 23, 2011, earthquake tectonics are dominated by strike-slip faulting on the East (in southern Turkey) and North (in northern Turkey) Anatolian fault zones. These large, translational fault systems extend across much of central and western Turkey and accommodate the western motion of the Anatolian block as it is being squeezed by the converging Arabian and Eurasian plates. In the area of Lake Van and further east, tectonics are dominated by the Bitlis Suture Zone (in eastern Turkey) and Zagros fold and thrust belt (toward Iran). The October 23, 2011 earthquake occurred in a broad region of convergence beyond the eastern extent of Anatolian strike-slip tectonics. The focal mechanism of today&#39;s earthquake is consistent with oblique-thrust faulting similar to mapped faults in the region.\r\n</p><p>This earthquake is a reminder of the many deadly seismic events that Turkey has suffered in the recent past. The devastating Izmit earthquake of 1999 (M &#61; 7.6) broke a section of the North Anatolian Fault 1000 km to the west of the October 23 event and killed 17,000 people, injured 50,000, and left 500,000 homeless. Approximately 70 km from this earthquake a M7.3 earthquake occurred on November 11, 1976 destroying several villages near the Turkey and Iran border and killing several thousand people. A M7.8 earthquake struck Erzincan in 1939, killing an estimated 33,000 people.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>2011, October 23. 604 killed, 32938 affected, $1500 million damage.

Arabian plate lithosphere is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate at the Makran coast of Pakistan and Iran, and becomes progressively deeper to the north.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe subducted Arabian plate is known to be seismically active to depths of about 160 km. The frequency of moderate and large earthquakes within the subducted Arabian plate is not high compared with similar events in some other subducted plates worldwide, but several earthquakes have occurred within this slab in the region of today&#39;s event over the past 40 years, including a magnitude 6.7 shock 50 km to the south in 1983.

At the location of the earthquake, the Cocos plate subducts to the northeast beneath the North America plate at a velocity of approximately 79 mm/yr, forming the Middle America subduction zone. The mechanism of the earthquake is consistent with extension within the down-going Cocos slab.

Asked to confirm reports the quake had claimed three lives, Alejandro Maldonado, director of Guatemalan emergency authority CONRED, said: &#34;Yes, unfortunately.&#34;\r\nLuis Rivera, governor of the San Marcos region, said at least 48 homes suffered significant damage in the local town of La Reforma, whose municipal cemetery was also destroyed. &#34;This quake was pretty strong. Families in the area are really scared because of the whole experience of November 2012.

Felt in many parts of central and northern California from Arcata to Bakersfield. Felt (II) at Reno, Nevada. Also felt at Carson City, Glenbrook, Incline Village, Minden and Sparks. <p><b>Tectonic Summary</b></p><p>The earthquake lies within a 70-km-wide set of major faults of the San Andreas Fault system that forms the boundary between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. The persistent northwestward movement of the Pacific plate relative to North America primarily causes right-lateral slip across the major faults, but also causes deformation between the major faults. The ongoing complex deformation field is revealed by modern geodetic surveys and earthquake patterns as well as the regional geologic structure. The earthquake is located at the eastern shore of San Pablo Bay between two major active fault systems: the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault system on the west and the Concord-Green Valley Fault system on the east. The earthquake occurred near the well-known West Napa Fault, and the less well known Carneros-Franklin Faults, which juxtapose different suites of rocks. </p><p>Historically, in this region shaking sufficient to seriously damage structures at Mare Is occurred during the M6.8 1868 Hayward Fault earthquake, the M7.8 1906 San Andreas Fault earthquake, and particularly during the M6.3 1898 Mare Is earthquake. The 1898 earthquake may have occurred about 20 km to the northwest on the southern Rodgers Creek Fault. </p><p>The 1999 Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities (WG99, 1999) concluded that Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault system has a 32% probability of generating a large earthquake (M6.7-7.4) by year 2030, and the Concord-Green Valley Fault system has a 6% chance of generating a large earthquake (M\u22656.7) in same period.</p><p>The earthquake occurred near the north shore of San Pablo Bay. The bayshore areas in the region are underlain by landfill and bay mud and have experienced disproportionately greater damage during historic earthquakes. Such damage is caused by soil failure in the fills and amplification of ground shaking by soft bay mud.</p><p>(above ref #1053)</p><p>M6.0 earthquake hit near Napa Valley Sunday, injuring at least 172 people and causing extensive damage, including fires sparked by burst gas lines...spokesman said that ~70,000 customers in Sonoma &amp; Napa counties lost power during the earthquake.(ref #11055)</p><p>Napa County officials Thurs requested federal disaster aid in the wake of Sunday&#39;s earthquake and placed damage estimates at $362 million in building, infrastructure and economic losses...More than 120 businesses in the wine and agriculture industry suffered $48 million worth of damage, according to a county news release.

At least 13 deaths and more than 100 injuries have been blamed on the earthquake. \r\nThree of the deaths were due to falling debris in and around Imphal, the capital of India&#39;s Manipur state, police said. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake&#39;s epicenter was 18 miles (29 kilometers) west of Imphal.\r\nFive other deaths in other parts of the state were also due to falling debris, said police officer A.K. Jalajit. According to the Associated Press, nearly 90 members of India&#39;s National Disaster Response Force, a specialized federal force for natural disasters, have left to check on remote areas, police said.\r\nIn Bangladesh, which lies west of the epicenter, the Dhaka Tribune named five people who died during the earthquake, all due to collapsing or suffering cardiac arrest during or immediately after the quake. None of the deaths were blamed on traumatic injuries, but the newspaper&#39;s website said many high-rise buildings swayed during the tremor, and three residential buildings were left leaning to one side. At least 33 people in Bangladesh were injured, some after jumping from buildings fearing they might collapse. (reference #11334)\r\n<p>The injuries and fatalities were caused by falling debris around Imphal, the capital of India&#39;s Manipur state.\r\nMany buildings were damaged across the region as walls cracked and crumbled as the ground shook. The epicenter of the quake was in Manipur, 29 km (18 miles) west of Imphal, according to theUSGS. Imphal is a city with a population over 220,000.

The canyon, which is about twice as deep as the Grand Canyon, is popular with tourists for hiking and watching the large Andean condor bird. The earthquake wasn&#39;t large for Peru, but it caused damage due to the epicenter&#39;s proximity to rural towns and its shallow depth of about 6 miles. Local media showed images of collapsed homes and churches. Roads into the canyon were blocked by landslides triggered by the quake. Yamila Osorio, the governor of the Arequipa state, where the quake occurred, told RPP Noticias on Monday that at least nine people had died and dozens more were injured as at least 80 homes collapsed. Civil defense agency Indeci identified one of the victims as a 66-year-old American. Ms. Osorio said efforts to reach the area were slowed by blocked roads into the rugged, mountainous region.

        "comments": "This strong earthquake occurred in the Pacific off the coast of Los Santos in Panama. The earthquake was preceded by a strong foreshock at 18 h 48 m (UT) on 1 October. Owing to the fact that very few masonry buildings exist in the province the damage was not as great as it otherwise would have been and there was no loss of life. Much of the more serious damage was done in the south of the Azuero Peninsula. Many of the houses at Tonosi and in the valley were damaged and a few collapsed, without causing casualties. In the villages and farms of Arenas, Bebedero, Cacao, Canajagua, Flores, Joaquin, Mogolon, Olivita and others in the Rio Viejo and Rio Joaquin valleys, all houses with tile roofs were damaged. Extensive cracking and liquefaction of the ground was observed along the banks of the river at Pajanosa, as well as on the main road to Tonosi. At Cacao and along the bank of Rio Viejo at Las Huertas the shock caused widespread liquefaction. Near Cerro Bonita it was found that the Rio Joaquin had cut a new channel, caused by the opening of fissures at a bend in its channel. The shock caused many landslides in this area, mostly of surface material from steep slopes.\r\n<p>Further to the north native ranches with grass roofs were nowhere seriously affected. At Guarare a few houses lost their tiles and at Macaracas the church was badly damaged and its tower, 25 m high, collapsed. At Los Santos a few houses were cracked but the Government building was totally ruined. The police barracks were also badly damaged, as well as the 35 m high church tower. At Pese there was no damage and at Tablas the walls of th] church and its tower were cracked but were little damaged. Sporadic but minor damage extended to Santiago and to the provinces of Veraguas and Cocle. The shock was very strong at Anton and Penonome. In the Panama isthmus a few houses suffered some minor damage and church bells were set ringing. The earthquake causing considerable panic but no damage to the lock structures of the canal. The earthquake was felt in the districts of David .and Bocas del Toro but not in Costa Rica. A few hours. after the earthquake a submarine slide ruptured the Central &amp; South American cable near the islet of Frailes del Norte, about 25 km off the south coast of Los Santos province. It has been reported that the broken end of the cable was found at a depth of 1463 m, whereas when the cable was first laid, the depth was only about 305.m. Here the shock caused an abrupt change in the bathymetry, which suggests that submarine sliding occurred. The tide gauge at Balboa showed no abnormal fluctuations of the.sea level, and, except in the Gulf of San Miguel on the east coast of the Gulf of Panama, from where it was reported that the sea behaved abnormally on the day of the earthquake, there is no evidence of aseismic sea wave. The earthquake was followed by a long sequence of strong aftershocks until mid-November. The earthquake was well recorded and instrumental readings confirm a position at the southeast extremity of the peninsula of Azuero (Fig. A5). Macroseismic effects suggest a focus in the upper crust.

        "comments": "The August 19, 2018, 14:56 UTC, M 6.9 earthquake near Belanting, Indonesia, occurred as the result of shallow thrust faulting on or near The Flores Back Arc Thrust. This event occurred 14 days after the August 5, 2018, M6.9 earthquake near Pulau Lombok, Indonesia which killed at least 476 people. Both events have a similar depth and mechanism. Preliminary focal mechanisms for the August 19 earthquake indicates slip occurred on either a shallow, south-dipping thrust fault, or on a steep, north dipping reverse fault. At the latitude of this earthquake, the Sunda and Australia plates converge in a north-south direction at a rate of about 70 mm/yr. The location of this earthquake is consistent with it occurring as southward-oriented thrust faulting on the Flores Back Arc Thrust.\r\n<p>At the location of this event, the Sunda plate underthrusts the Indonesian Arc to the south, along the Flores Back Arc Thrust local to this earthquake, and along the Wetar Back Arc Thrust farther to the east. To the south, the Australia plate also underthrusts the arc to the north, along the Java Trench. This Flores region marks the transition between traditional oceanic plate subduction in the west (Australia plate beneath Sunda) to continental collision in the east. As a result, two opposite-verging thrust systems are evident in cross-sections, and the northward subducting slab of the Australia plate exists at depth beneath the Indonesian Islands and the Flores Sea. The focal mechanism solution and depth of this earthquake indicate it is associated with the Flores Back Arc Thrust system, rather than the deeper Australia slab.\r\n</p><p>Prior to the August 5, 2018 earthquake two weeks prior to today&#39;s event, there had been six other events of M 6.5 or larger over the previous century. Four of these are likely to have occurred on the back arc thrust system; a M 6.5 in the Bali region to the west of Lombok in July 1976, and three events of M 6.5, M6.5, and M 6.6 in the Sumbawa region to the east of Lombok in November 2007 and November 2009. The Sumbawa earthquakes were associated with several deaths, hundreds of injuries, and hundreds of houses being destroyed. Since the August 5, 2018 earthquake there have been 10 M 5 and greater earthquakes. Four of these have had magnitudes larger than M 6, including an M 6.3 earthquake ~10 hours prior to this August 19, 14:56 UTC earthquake. Both the August 19, 2018 event, and the August 5, 2018 earthquake, were M 6.9.\r\n</p><p>(all above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>Temporary data collected by BNPB Command Post until Monday (08/20/2018) at 10.45 WIB, recorded 10 people died, 24 people were injured, 151 houses were damaged (7 seriously damaged, 5 were damaged, 139 were slightly damaged) and 6 units of worship facilities. This is temporary data because data collection is still ongoing. Total power outages caused communication and data collection to be hampered. Of the 10 people who died as a result of the 6.9 earthquake, they came from East Lombok Regency, 4 people, Sumbawa Besar 5 people, and Sumbawa Barat 1 person. The joint SAR team from Basarnas, TNI, Police, ESDM, and volunteers are still evacuating. (reference #12206)</p>",

On a broad scale, the seismotectonics of the region near this earthquake are controlled by the collision of these plates. At the location of this event, the Arabia plate converges with Eurasia in a northerly direction at a rate of approximately 27 mm/yr.\r\n</p><p>North and west of the November 7, 2019, earthquake, tectonics are dominated by both collision and strike-slip faulting in the northern Zagros (Iran) and Bitlis suture zone (eastern Turkey), with strike slip faulting organizing further west onto the East (in southern Turkey) and North (in northern Turkey) Anatolian fault zones. These large, translational fault systems extend across much of central and western Turkey and accommodate the western motion of the Anatolian block as it is being squeezed by the converging Arabia and Eurasia plates. Tectonics east of the November 7, 2019, earthquake are dominated by convergence across the Alborz Mountains of north-central Iran. The November 7, 2019, earthquake occurred in a region of oblique convergence beyond the eastern extent of Anatolian strike-slip tectonics. The focal mechanism solution of this earthquake shows predominantly strike-slip motion but is consistent with the oblique nature of faulting in the surrounding region. Past earthquakes in the vicinity of this event also demonstrate strike-slip focal mechanism solutions\r\n</p><p>Moderate-to-large earthquakes occur regularly in eastern Turkey and northwest Iran. Six other M6&#43; events have occurred within 250 km of the November 7, 2019 earthquake over the preceding 40 years. The largest of these was a M 7.4 earthquake in June, 1990, about 190 km to the southeast of todays event. The 1990 event caused close to 50,000 fatalities, and extensive damage throughout the region. A pair of M 6.4 and M 6.2 events on August 11, 2012, 90 km to the northwest of the November 7, 2019 earthquake, resulted in over 300 fatalities and heavy damage in the epicentral region.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12547:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>The earthquake has killed five and injured 584, who mostly received outpatient services, according to officials. Sixty-six people were injured due to the destruction of their homes and 518 others due to panic or rushing to the exits. The Red Crescent provided emergency shelter to 1,100 households in the seven most affected villages. The worst damage is reported in Varnakesh village with 40 demolished houses. This earthquake was felt in the six towns of East Azerbaijan province, including Miyaneh, Tark, Sarab, Turkman Chay, Bostan Abad, Hashtrood, and 145 villages[...]The earthquake killed 200 livestock.

Focal mechanism solutions for the event indicate rupture occurred on either a shallowly dipping thrust fault striking towards the west or on a steeply dipping reverse fault striking towards the ESE. The depth and focal mechanism solutions of the event are consistent with its occurrence on the subduction zone interface between these plates, approximately 100 km northeast of the Middle America Trench, where the Cocos plate begins its descent into the mantle beneath Mexico. In the region of this earthquake, the Cocos plate moves approximately northeastward at a rate of 60 mm/yr.<br />While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as slip over a larger fault area. Reverse faulting events of the size of the June 23, 2020 earthquake are typically about 70 x 35 km in size (length x width). Historically, several significant earthquakes have occurred along the southern coast of Mexico. In 1932, a M 8.4 thrust earthquake struck in the region of Jalisco, several hundred kilometers to the northwest of the June 23rd event. On October 9, 1995, a M 8.0 earthquake struck in the Colima-Jalisco region, resulting in at least 49 fatalities and leaving 1,000 people homeless. The deadliest nearby earthquake occurred on September 19, 1985, in the Michoacan region ~700 km to the northwest of the June 23rd event. This M 8.0 earthquake resulted in at least 9,500 fatalities, injured about 30,000 people, and left 100,000 people homeless. In 2003, a M 7.6 earthquake in Colima, Mexico, resulted in 29 fatalities, destroyed more than 2,000 homes and left more than 10,000 people homeless. In March 2012, a M 7.4 earthquake 250 km to the northwest of the June 23rd, 2020 event killed 2 and injured 11 in the Oaxaca region. The hypocenter of the September 8th, 2017, M 8.2 earthquake offshore Chiapas is located 240 km southeast of today&#39;s earthquake. That event caused at least 78 fatalities and 250 injuries in Oaxaca, and a further 16 deaths in Chiapas. Eleven days later, a M 7.1 earthquake struck closer to Mexico City, 390 km northwest of today&#39;s earthquake, resulting in over 300 fatalities and significant damage in Mexico City and the surrounding region. In February 2018, a M 7.2 struck 225 km to the northwest of this event that injured four people and damaged 1,000 homes in Oaxaca. In addition, a military helicopter surveying the damage crashed at Jamiltepec, killing 14 people on the ground and injuring 15 others.</p><p><i>Ref #12895:</i><br />[...] coastal uplift of 0.53 m near the epicenter and decreasing farther away from it; uplift was up to 0.8 m in areas related to exposure of the coast.

Preliminary estimates of the depth and mechanism of the earthquake are consistent with the earthquake having occurred in the continental lithosphere above the ~90 km deep subducted Philippine Sea plate. Focal mechanism solutions indicate that rupture occurred on either a west-southwest or east-southeast dipping reverse fault with a component of either right-lateral strike-slip motion to the northeast or left-lateral strike-slip motion to the southeast. At the location of the earthquake, the Philippine Sea plate moves west-northwest at a velocity of about 100 mm/yr with respect to the Sunda plate.\u00a0<br />While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes the size of the August 11, 2021 event are more appropriately described as slip over a larger fault area. Earthquakes of this size are typically about 50x20 km (length x width).<br />As at many subduction zone plate boundaries, the Philippines frequently experiences moderate to large earthquakes. 142 earthquakes of M6 or larger have occurred over the past 100 years within 250 km of the August 11, 2021 earthquake, including a M7.0 earthquake on January 21, 2021, approximately 180 km SSE. Earthquakes in the Philippines region exhibit diverse styles of faulting that are indicative of the locally complex tectonic motions. Moreover, this region experiences earthquakes across a range of depths, from shallow surface rupturing strike-slip earthquakes, to deep earthquakes located within subducting oceanic slabs. While magnitude 7.0 earthquakes are capable of causing severe damage to infrastructure, this earthquake was fortunately located far from built structures.</p><p><i>Reference #13005:</i><br />A 20-year-old man in Tandag City, Surigao del Sur reportedly died after being hit in the head by falling coconuts following the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that shook parts of Mindanao on Thursday dawn.</p>",

Ardabil was probably affected by these earthquakes. There was also an eclipse of the sun accompanied by winds carrying black ash in the region.\r\nThese phenomena suggest that there was also associated with earthquakes volcanic activity in this region (Oldham 1883: Ibn-ul-Athir; Mushketoff &amp; Orloff 1910).

The area worst affected was that of the city of Dvin and its immediate surroundings, which had already suffered considerable damage in an earthquake thirty years before. All but about 100 houses were destroyed, together with the great church and palace of the Catholicos, and 30000 people were killed, Damage extended over the plateau of Artashat where landslides added to the destruction, and Grigor, Bishop of R&#39;tshunik and some of his followers who happened to be in retreat in the mountains, perished.

        "comments": "The earthquake on May 20, 1202, has been incorrectly reported as from 2 to 4 events covering the period 1201-1204. Excerpts from reference #2799 summarizing the analysis of this earthquake are listed below:<p>\r\nA large earthquake was widely felt in the Middle East around daybreak on the morning of 20 May 1202. Contemporary sources indicate that the shock was felt from Lesser Armenia, parts of Anatolia and northwest Iran down to Qus in upper Egypt, and from Sicily in the west to Iraq and Mesopotamia in the east. Along with this very large felt area, an ensuing seismic sea-wave and aftershock sequence, the earthquake was\r\nassociated with extensive and serious damage in Syria and to a lesser extent in Cyprus, with great loss of life... Despite the conspicuous duality of accounts in almost all Muslim sources, probably reflecting protracted aftershock activity, there remains no evidence of more than one principal earthquake... The loss of life caused by this earthquake and its aftershocks is difficult to estimate. A figure frequently quoted in Arab sources is 1,100,000 dead for the year 597-598 H. (A.D. 1201-1202). This specifically includes those dying of famine and the epidemic consequent on the failure of the Nile floods. More realistically, the figure of <b>30,000 casualties</b> is given, primarily, it would seem, in the Nablus area. No reliance can be placed on such figures, but the fact that the main shock occurred at dawn, when most people were in bed, without noticeable foreshocks, probably contributed to a high death toll.\r\n</p><p>Aftershocks were reported from Hamah, Damascus, and Cairo, for at least four days, one of which, apparently felt in Cairo and Hamah, must have been a large event. There remains the possibility that the aftershock sequence was terminated with a destructive shock that totally\r\ndestroyed what was left of Nablus, but it seems preferable to consider both reports by Sibt b. al-Jausi as referring to the same one shock. Whatever the exact sequence of events, the cumulative effects of the earthquake were clearly catastrophic... the magnitude of the 1202 earthquake should be Ms &#61; 7.6.\r\n</p><p>The tsunami is often associated with the date May 22, 1202.

Damascus, destroyed, 5700 killed, Aleppo fortress destroyed, intensity VIII-IX. \r\n<blockquote><i>Reference #9116</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1344, January 3. This was a damaging earthquake in southeast Anatolia. It occurred on the fourth hour of Saturday, 16 Sha&#39;ban 744 a.H. (3 January 1344); it killed about 5000 people and destroyed towns or heavily damaged a number of towns and castles. Membij was totally destroyed with many casualties, the citadel of al-Rawandan (Revand), (Rumkale) and the castles of Behasna (Besni), Kakhta (Kiahta) and Karkar (Gerger) suffered various degrees of damage. The effects of the earthquake extended as far as Aleppo, where the citadel suffered some damage, and Madjdin (Mardin?).\r\n</p><p>A contemporary Armenian source adds that the loss of life at Mnoec (Membij) alone was 5000 and that in this earthquake the castle of Prinkes(?) totally collapsed. The location of Prinkes is in doubt; it may be Prakana, on the right bank of Gok Su to the northwest of Silifke (Dedeyan 1980, 64 n. 719).\r\n</p><p>There was some damage at Aleppo too. When a weaker aftershock occurred some time later, the Aleppians evacuated their city, perhaps fearing further damage, and camped some distance outside.\r\n</p><p>Further aftershocks may have followed. Because of the damage and continuing aftershocks, Aleppo was evacuated for &#39;forty&#39; days after the earthquake, which was also felt in Damascus, and poems were composed on the event.\r\n</p><p>Ibn al-Wardi dates the earthquake to a.H. 744, Sha&#39;aban 16 (3 January 1344), a Saturday, at the fourth hour of the day (10 am). He mentions Mambij and gives an estimate of 5700 deaths. He remarks that &#39;some people say&#39; that it spread as far as Majdin (Mardin?), due east of Rumkale.\r\n</p><p>A fourteenth-century Armenian chronicle mentions a violent earthquake in a.Arm. 793 (26 December 1343 to 24 December 1344), which destroyed the castle of Prinkes and Mnpec (Mambij), killing 5000 in the latter (Het. Pat. ii. 88). It is possible that two earthquakes have been syncretised here, since, if the earthquake was destructive at such a distance from Mambij, one would expect Antioch, which is not mentioned in the sources, to have been damaged too.\r\n</p><p>Al-Suyuti says that this earthquake was felt in Egypt. In fact there is no information about the effects of this earthquake south of Damascus, where the shock was only slight.</p>",

As a result of the earthquaie the sea rose and fell 3 m, flooding the city of Rhodes.... (ref #9116)\r\n<p>May 3, 1481. In 1481 the island of Rhodes was shaken by earthquakes which lasted ten months. This seismic activity is described... <br /> ... the first of these shocks was felt in the city of Rhodes at nine in the morning of Mar 15 (1481); this shock was followed by many other which threw the populace in consternation. At 3 in the night of May 3, a much stronger shock occurred and at the same time it began to rain, with such an impetuosity, that it was thought that the island was sinking under the weight of the sky. While the land was shaking with great violence, a strong wind coming from the high seas caused the water to rise over ten feet above sea level, and flooding the land threatened the city of Rhodes with total and final destruction. The wind was so violent, and the shocks so numerous (the ground was shaken, seven times that day) that the Rhodians thought their island was bound to sink. Soon after, however, all of a sudden, the waters retired to their habitual places, the sea became calm again, and the shaking of the ground stopped. It was found that not a single house in the city collapsed. In the harbour only, the violence of the waves caused the cables of a large ship to snap, which drifted and crashed on a reef, sinking with all its crew. The shaking of the ground continued till the 3rd of October when it stopped for a few weeks. But the physical primer mover of these subterraneous phenomena which produce earthquakes, soon after, built up again, and repeated earthquakes reoccurred on Dec 18. (ref #26)\r\n</p><p>May 3, 1481, night (also Mar 15, May 5,12, Oct 3, Dec 18), (36N, 28E or 38.2N, 28.5E, intensity IX or intensity X, magnitude 7.1, tsunami intensity 3). Hellenic Arc, Island of Rhodes. The strong earthquake caused destruction in the town of Rhodes; many people were killed. Numerous aftershocks were felt till the second half of 1482. Then the sea rose over 3 m (from other data 1.8 m) and gushed onto the shore. Mooring lines of a big ship lying in the harbour were torn; a ship ran on a reef and was lost with all its crew when the water receded. The damage done by the tsunami waves was greater than the damage caused by the earthquake. (ref #2130).\r\n</p><p>1481, Cairo intensity VII, Mecca intensity VII, Syria, Palestine, 30,000 killed. (ref #1222)\r\n</p><p>Mar 18, 1481, Sunday 17 Muharram&#39; 886, Mediterranean.\r\nOn 28 Muharram (29 March), news arrived in Damascus of a shock in three or five villages in Anatolia (al-Rum). Later, further news arrived of the death of the Qadi Sharafal-Din b. Id in Egypt because of this earthquake,\r\nwhen a decorative cresting on the Salihiyya madrasa in\r\nCairo fell on him and another man who died with him. The most detailed accounts of the effects in Egypt report that the earthquake was frightening in Cairo and Misr (Fustat) and the surrounding region. Reports came from Alexandria and even Anatolia. In Cairo, the shock struck about an hour after the afternoon prayer on 17 Muharram. The shaking was severe, and the minarets were seen to sway and undulate. <i>The shock in Cairo is clearly a distant effect of a larger event in the eastern Mediterranean, most probably the earthquake of 15 Mar that ruined Rhodes and Cyprus, setting off a damaging sea-wave on the coast of Adalia</i>.

(ref #1002)\r\n</p><p>1511, Mar 25. Immediately after the main shock (or foreshock) at 15h other earthquakes followed and a culmination was reached in the evening after 20h with a very intensive event which caused great destruction mainly in the Fruili area. The strongest effects of the shock at 15h were observed mainly in the region of western Slovenia. The aftershock series which followed was observed in both regions, i.e. in Slovenia and in Fruili, and they lasted until Feb 19, 1512 and sporadically up to the end of 1516.\r\n</p><p>...Independent sources from Carniola (Slovenia) and the Friuli region indicate clearly two different origin times, as indicated above.\r\n</p><p>...The geographical distribution of the observed effects during the aftershock series show a remarkable difference in both regions. The complete reconstruction of the event gives the most probable picture of a very strong foreshock in the Idrija zone, followed hours later by an even stronger event in the region of Gemona-Tolmin. This earthquake was felt throughout central Europe.\r\n</p><p>...It is estimated that in spite of their weak resistance\r\nto lateral forces, an intensity of 8 MSK scale was necessary to produce such destructive effects. Even simple structures such as fortification walls, towers and gate-towers with favourable width to height ratios were ruined in some places. It is important to note that at least 95 % of all buildings at that time in Slovenia were constructed of wood. Many villages therefore remained relatively intact, and because of the sparsely peopled country, the <b>number of victims was low</b>... \r\n</p><p>Some of the aftershocks of 1511 events were very strong and caused more destruction in the whole area. Most remarkable of all is the event of August 8, 1511 in Cividale which caused a death toll of about 3000 human lives.\r\n</p><p>Both earthquakes had a strong impact upon social and economic life in the region. In the Friuli region with about 26,000 to 27,000 inhabitants, the human loss was about 12,000 people but only a part of this figure can be attributed to earthquakes. Bonito (1691) says clearly that 12,000 deaths were due to earthquakes, wars, famine and plague. Most cities and castles in the country were rebuilt in the years following. Damage amounting to 200,000 florins was estimated in the town of Ljubljana alone.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1123)</p>",

        "comments": "1842, May 7, 5 p.m. Cap-Haitien was violently shaken by an MS 8.1 earthquake (19.5 N, 72.1 W) which occurred in the Northern Depression of Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic). It extended from Samana to Mole St. Nicolas, and crossing the Windward Passage, was felt along the Sierra Maestra in Cuba, and throughout the Antilles. The shocks annihilated the northwest Cape, and killed 5,000 people (about half the population) at Cap-Haitien alone.&#34; Scherer (1912) reported, &#34;In less than one minute the towns of Cap-Haitien, Santiago de los Caballeros, Port-de-Paix, Mole St. Nicolas, and Fort Liberte were reduced to heaps of ruins.&#34; Taber (1922) said, &#34;The distribution of intensities and the phenomena of the accompanying sea-wave indicate that the earthquake resulted from a vertical displacement along the fault passing between Tortuga Island and St. Nicholas Peninsula.&#34; Shocks were also felt at Santo Domingo, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and almost all the West Indies. (ref #1492)\r\n<p>Scherer correlates five great earthquakes with the northern valley, which, as we have seen, is a physiographic manifestation of the Cayman Islands-Sierra Maestra-North Haiti fault zone. The shock of May 7, 1842 was the most destructive, though the intensity may have been no higher than during the earthquake of 1564... The distribution of intensities and the phenomena of the accompanying sea wave indicate that the earthquake resulted from a vertical displacement along a fault passing between Tortuga Island and the St. Nicholas Peninsula. The displacement may have continued eastward into the island, for it is stated that the-bed of the Yaqui River was suddenly heaved up driving its waters both up and down the stream. Along the coast the ocean first withdrew and then returned causing much destruction. (ref #427)\r\n</p><p>1842, May 7, 1700 6 MT. Destructive shock in Santo Domingo. Apparently felt in Jamaica and Puerto Rico. A terrible earthquake doing much damage and killing many people, especially in Haiti. Felt in San Juan. (ref #1189)\r\n</p><p>The following is from Ref #535:\r\n</p><p>1842, May 7. Haiti, Cap Haitien (IX) 17.3C h. Reduced to ruins. The shocks were so sudden that most of the inhabitants did not have time to leave their homes. The town was well constructed of stone and brick and was one of the finest cities of the Antilles. The ground opened in long cracks, mostly running north to south but some east to west. During the night, fires increased the death toll. It is estimated that over 5,0OO persons perished out of a population of 9,000-10,000 in Cap Haitien alone.</p><p>St. Domingo, Santiago de los Caballeros (IX) 17.30 h. Reduced to ruins although the houses were low and well-constructed. Many of the 2,000 inhabitants were killed-estimates vary between 100 and 500 deaths. The flow of the river Yaqui was interrupted.</p><p>Haiti, Port de Paix (IX) 17.30 h. Ruined by the earthquake and then overwhelmed by a wave. The sea drew back 200 feet from the shore and then advanced to cover the city with over 15 feet of water. No buildings at all remained standing. 200 out of 3,009 inhabitants perished.</p><p>Haiti, Mole St. Nicolaa (IX) 17.30 h. This fortified town of stone was entirely ruined by the shock. Only a &#34;plan par terre&#34; remained.</p><p>Haiti, Fort Liberte (IX) Reduced to ruins.</p><p>Haiti, Port-au-Prince (VII) a stone bas-relief fell from the facade of the Senate House. The south western peninsula apparently suffered least in the island.</p>",

It came in the midst of a religious service at the Zenkozi Temple so that <b>thousands of devout worshippers were among the victims, besides some 8,500 others</b> that met the same fate. \r\n</p><p>Fires promptly broke out in the towns of Zenkozi, Iiyama, Inariyama, Sinmati, etc., and practically completed the destruction. In Zenkozi out of a total of 2,236 dwellings only 142 were left unscathed by fire or earthquake. \r\n</p><p>The most characteristic phenomenon in connection with this earthquake, however, was the extraordinary large number of landslides that took place and the consequences which they brought about. It is said that the number altogether did not fall short of 43,000, hence small wonder that many villages were buried under falling debris. The largest of these occurred between Komatubara and Sinmati and completely blocked the course of the River Saikawa, with the result that in the course of a week or two there came into existence a temporary lake measuring 28km by 4km at its widest part. This new lake however was not destined to remain for long, for at the end of 19 days the blocking dam gave way and let loose the enormous quantity of water, giving rise to a terrible inundation which carried destruction before it, sweeping everything off both banks of the lower river course. Some 4,500 houses and 35 persons were thus swept away. \r\n</p><p>The topographical changes, with which we are most concerned in connection with our studies, duly appeared in the form of a conspicuous fault line. It was in the meizoseismal area with a trend SW-NE and extended for about 8 km. At a point near Nagano the NW side of the fault had arisen as much as 2.4 meters relatively to the opposite side.</p>",

The earthquake was felt on all the Hawaiian Islands.<p>The events unfolded as follows. On March 27, light shocks began to be felt in the Kau and Kona districts. On the following day, they spread northwest to the boundaries of Kona district, and east to Hilo. Smoke and flames appeared in small volume in different places at the top of the Mauna Loa volcano on the 27th. The shocks became increasingly noticeable and the main earthquake took place on April 2 at 15:40... </p><p>In Kau district, all stone and even more solid homes collapsed; the large stone church at Waiohinu collapsed in 10 seconds. People and animals were thrown to the ground. The residents had to sit on all fours to keep from rolling. At Keaiwa, Kahuki, Punaluu, Ninole, Waiohinu and other settlements, according to accounts, wooden homes were torn from their foundations or overturned; straw huts with piles, dug into the\r\nground, collapsed completely. At Kapapala, a 280 ton (1700 barrels) cistern burst and scattered in bits. In all, the shocks resulted in the collapse of 46 homes. On a ship in the focal zone, the jib boom hit the water and broke.</p><p>In Kona district, the destruction was not so universal, although the tremors were strong. At Hilo, the only stone home collapsed, furniture shifted and people ran from their homes. </p><p>Along the entire south coast of the island and in the interior, numerous collapses, slides and rock falls took place. In Wood Valley between Kapapala and Pahala, a mud flow came down. It was 5 1/2 km (3 miles) long, 1 km (1/2 mile) wide at the middle and 2 km (a mile) wide at\r\nthe head, with an average thickness of 2 m (6 feet), up to 6, 9 and 12 m (20, 30 and 40 feet) in places, such as in depressions of the relief.

Between Saqqizchi and Munaq on the southeast slopes of Kuh-i Buzqush and along the Garm-rud, all villages were totally destroyed, in most cases leaving no survivors.

The earthquake was felt, but without material damage, in the provinces, of Isabela and Cagayan.</p><p>The tremors were destructive almost exclusively on soggy loose grounds: along coasts and river valleys, including along the banks of the Rig and Little Pampanga, Pasig and Agno Rivers. Bacolor suffered most of all. At Manila, many buildings were destroyed, mainly in the flood plain of the Pasig River, but not one of them collapsed. </p><p>There were huge avalanches in the pleistoseismic area, on the slopes of the Sierra Madre, including at Bongabon. Numerous cracks of different sizes opened up in the ground in the eastern part of the central plain of the island.</p><p>The tremors were very strong in the region of Infanta at Binanconan. All three stone structures, the church, the bell tower and the monastery, collapsed completely. The governor&#39;s homes, the court and the barracks, built of wood and palm leaves, were so heavily damaged that they had to be abandoned. More than 200 homes of wood and leaves collapsed; only the vertical props in their shattered earth pockets remained of some of them.</p><p>Large landslides and settling of the ground occurred along the banks of Puerto Real de Lamon Bay: at Cape Tacloyan and at the settlement of Quinanliman.</p><p>Other sources mention that 8 homes built out of light materials sank to one side at Baler during this earthquake. Cracks formed in the walls of stone buildings. An old abandoned tower collapsed. The ground cracked. Water and sand was ejected from the cracks, spoiling the crops. Landslides took place in the mountains. There were many recurrent shocks.</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1072:</i></blockquote> <p>July 18, 1880, 12:40 [local time], Intensity IX, severe damage.

Thirty-five persons died and 39 were seriously injured in the State of Sonora alone. Bavispe was totally devastated. <p>At Oputo, many buildings were completely leveled, while the rest were heavily damaged and collapsed during the aftershocks; 9 residents died and many were injured; water gushed up along ditches and in the valley.\r\n</p><p>At Guhsabas and Granados, most of the buildings were destroyed. Buildings were damaged at Opocura (29&#34; 55&#39; N., 109&#34; 29&#39; W.), the center of the Moctezuma district, at Concepcion Guerrero and Ciudad Juarez (Paso del Norte). The earthquake occurred with similar force at San Miguelito [30 km southeast of Fronteras], Baserac, Guachinera, and\r\nNacori (40 km southeast of Granados). \r\n</p><p>At Arizpe, several homes collapsed, while some other homes and the church were &#39;destroyed; fissures appeared in ploughland and in lowlands and water spouted from them; the ground subsided at several places; enormous blocks rolled down from the mountain tops, raising clouds of dust on the slopes. All the buildings cracked at Bacoachica; deep funnels appeared in the ground, and large cracks, spouting water, appeared in the lowlands and on the banks of the river.\r\n</p><p>At Aronteras, several homes were destroyed and still more were damaged; a mass of cracks appeared in the ground, from which water spouted in greater or lesser volume; the channel of the river dried up for an instant, but then water appeared again in abundance, and its discharge approximately doubled; clouds of dust arose from all the surrounding mountains.\r\n</p><p>The entire valley between Bocadehuachi (29&#34; 44&#39; N., 109&#34; 30&#39;W.) and Cuchuta was covered with cracks from which issued water; the ground subsided in places; the tops of adjacent mountains collapsed.\r\n</p><p>Cracks also appeared in many places in the valley between \r\nPorvenir and Agua Prieta. An abundance of water poured forth from these cracks, so that the ground became swampy and impassable. \r\n</p><p>At Janos, almost all homes were destroyed. Homes and the church suffered seriously at Galeana; the tremors lasted 20-25 seconds, The earthquake was strong at Nuevo Casas Grandes&#39;. The earthquake was rather strdng at Ures and Santa Rosalia. \r\n</p><p>The earthquake was felt, but did not do any serious damage, at Nogales, Magdalena, Baroyeca, Buenavista, Alamos, and also, according to not quite reliable sources, at San Francisco and Masatlan.\r\n</p><p>At Chihuahua and Rosales, the tremors lasted 5-10 seconds and frightened the residents. The earthquake was rather strong at San Andres and damaged buildings; one of the nearby springs began to eject more water, mixed with colored clay; after awhile, the color and discharge of\r\nwater returned to normal. The tremors were mild at Guaymas.\r\n</p><p>Near the lighthouse on Haro Cape, following the earthquake the water retreated from shore a considerable distance, and then retreated again several times with the same force. An unstable part of the hill to the west of the lighthouse collapsed from the impact of the tidal waves\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)</p>",

At Soboba Hot Springs, several miles east of San Jacinto, six Indians were killed and eight were injured by the collapse of the wall of an adobe.

        "comments": "There was an extremely strong earthquake in the center of Chile, with source near Valparaiso. According to the director of the meteorological observatory at Santiago, the earthquake began suddenly without any preliminary rumble and with marked oscillations. Their amplitude gradually increased; strong oscillations lasted 1 1/2 minutes. According to other sources, the earthquake lasted 4-5 minutes in the focal zone.\r\n<p>The earthquake was felt as far as Tacna (Peru), Buenos Aires, Chiloe Island and the Juan Fernandez Islands. The seaquake was felt at Deseado Cape (Atlantic coast of Argentina). According to the Central International Seismological Bureau at Strasbourg and a number of investigators who collected press reports the intensity of temors at individual points was [IX-X Rossi Forel at Casablanca, Limache and Quillota].\r\n</p><p>The axis of the pleistoseismic zone of the earthquake may have been directed along the 20<sup>o</sup> azimuth. Weak structures on loose soil were almost the only ones destroyed. The territorial distribution of damage in such large cities as Valparaiso and Santiago is especially significant in this respect. At Valparaiso, damage was mainly done not by the earthquake itself, but by the subsequent fire. Limache was almost completely destroyed; 116 of 3000 residents died. The northern part of San Antonio was buried under a large mud flow. Many water and mud gryphons were formed on the plain near Curepto.\r\n</p><p>The residents of many coastal settlements observed luminous phenomena at the time of the earthquake (lightning, diffuse luminescence, falling stars, phosphorescent air near the ground, sparking of wires, etc.).\r\n</p><p>The shore at some places in the focal area was elevated 0.7-0.8 m and then slowly returned to its previous position. Apparently, due to the latter fact, the authenticity of the elevation was questioned by many specialists, including Montessus de Ballore, who soon after headed the seismological service in Chile.\r\n</p><p>A high level of seismic activity in the focal area continued for 18 months.\r\n</p><p>[The earthquake generated a tsunami that was observed all around the Pacific.]\r\n<br />\r\n(above from reference #415)\r\n</p><p>1906, 8:40 p.m., magnitude 8.6, Valparaiso, 4000 deaths.

The first reports mentioned some twenty shocks at Guatemala from december 20th to 22nd, but no damage was done. Later reports spoke of shocks at Chimaltenango, Escuintla, Amatitlan, and Sacatepequez, all of them in the volcanic region west of the city of Guatemala. On the 27th the town of Gracias in Honduras was partly destroyed, and another shock on the 29th nearly completed its ruin, and four thousand people were left without homes. The village of Talqua, Las Flores and S. Sebastian, all of them near Gracias, were also demolished. But few lives were lost, however. Shocks continued at S. Salvador, on the 30th, but they were less severe.\r\n</p><p>The following account has been received from our colleague, Dr. V. F. Marsters, who wrote from San Jacinto, Honduras, under date of December 31, 1915.\r\n</p><p>...On the night of December 27th some nine strong shocks were felt in Gracias, but these were strongest in Lsa Flores and Talgua. very soon after the shocks of Decemer 26th dense darkness followed with exceedingly heavy rainfall. The latest reports state that a small area in and about Gracias has sunk sufficiently to place a part of the townunder water.\r\n</p><p>Such data as we now have at hand show that the line of maximum intensity extended from Las Flores on the northwest, thence southeast to and through Gracias to La Espernza: that is, in a southeast-northwest direction. This line is approximately parallel to the range of mountains known under the names Sierra de Atima and Sierra de Opalaca.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #7955)</p>",

There was an earthquake with source to the south of Mindanao Island, near Sarangani Bay. It was felt all over Mindanao Island and in the eastern part of the Sulu archipelago. The tremors were strongest, 7-8 degrees (VIII-IX Rossi-Forel) to the east and southeast of Sarangani Bay, in particular at Glan. According to a report of the police station at Glan, the tremors lasted about a minute. Eighteen buildings collapsed, including the school, a new warehouse and so on. The public pier was completely put out of commission and required major repairs. All the buildings of the police station at Glan were destroyed, except for one new annex; two people were injured by falling beams. <b>Seven people died under a large landslide at Tuyan</b> (a suburb of Glan). A mass of cracks up to 1/2 m wide appeared in the ground. At many places, water and mud spurted up several meters. Recurrent shocks were felt all day and all night, and seven strong earthquakes and many weak ones were registered in Glan in February. A tidal wave 1-1 1/2 m high high appeared at Glan several minutes after the earthquake of January 31. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1187:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1917, January 31, 12:02 p.m. [local time].

The destroyed wooden structures suppose to have been of the temporary type used in such\r\noutlying posts, while the native houses are commonly a hut of bamboo and palm leaves, raised from one to three metres above the ground on bamboo or wooden poles very little\r\ndriven into the soil. Such structures are not earthquake-proof especially when the rocking lasts for nearly a minute, as happened in this instance. To these unfavourable conditions of the structures must be added the soft and loose character of the soil, consisting of volcanic\r\ntuff, sand and ashes, lightly covered in places by alluvial\r\nmaterial from the Glan River... The damage to all government buildings, property and supplies was estimated at $4,510.69. </p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1058:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1917, January 31. Intensity IX. S.

The earthquake on the evening of 22 June 1939 caused greatest damage in the Accra area, between the coast, Christiansborg, Kwasiman, Weija and Fette. Many adobe houses and some better buildings collapsed; there were <b>22 people killed</b> and about <b>130 injured</b>. A damage survey in the Accra region shows that nearly 1500 houses had to be demolished and that over 600 were uninhabitable until they had been repaired. Mud houses suffered most and well constructed concrete buildings least. Damage extended about 100 km from Accra with isolated foundation failures due to liquefaction, particularly around the Sakumo lagoon and along the coast. \r\n<p>...The instrumental surface-wave magnitude estimated from 17 stations was 6.4 (<u>&#43;</u>0.2) and the body-wave magnitude was 6.8 (<u>&#43;</u>0.3) from four stations. \r\n</p><p>The earthquake resulted in a prominent zone of ground rupture which extended in a N40 deg E direction over a distance of about 20 km between Weija and Fette on the coast, with the south-east side downthrown by as much as 40 cm. ...If it is assumed that the zone of ground rupture is associated with the causative fault of this earthquake, the epicentre of the event should be near 5.52 N, 0.32 W, about 20 km west of Accra, on land. The earthquake was followed by many aftershocks, the strongest of which occurred on 18 August and had a magnitude M<sub>s</sub> &#61; 5.3, <i>m</i> &#61; 6.0. It caused additional damage mainly in the north-east of Accra).\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1214)\r\n</p><p>The earthquake of 22nd June, 1939, occurred at  approximately 7.20 p.m. (G.M.T.) and was felt for about 20-30 seconds at Accra. The intensity of the shock was greatest in the area between Accra, Weija and Fete, and particularly around Nyanyanu and Tokuse and new the Sakume lagoon, where the intensity reached 9 on the modified Mercalli Scale used in this report.\r\n</p><p>The greatest damage to life and property occurred in Accra, the capital of the Gold Coast, where 16 people were killed and 133 injured, and hundreds of thousands of pounds damage was done to buildings. One person was killed and two wounded at Oblogo and a few people were injured in other towns and villages. Fortunately, the loss of life was smaller than might have been expected from the severity of the shock and the density of the population of Accra. This was largely due to the fact that the shock occurred at a time when everyone was awake and many were out of doors, and because there were no outbreaks of fire such as usually accompany severe earthquakes. The earthquake was preceded and followed by heavy falls of rain, 4.16 inches being recorded at Accra on 25th June.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake was felt by persons over an area of approximately 300,000 square miles, and at places mare than 500 miles from Accra. As the epicenter was probably out to sea some 25 miles from Accra it is likely that it would have been felt over an area of approximately 600,000 square miles if the whole of the area had been populated land.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1077)\r\n</p><p>June 22, 1939, Ghana, magnitude 6.5, 18 deaths.

The maximum intensity was estimated at 9 degrees; <b>30 people died and 25 were injured</b>. It was felt with a force of 3-4 degrees or more on an area of 400,000 km<sup>2</sup>, which included Huaras in the north, Serro de Pasco and Ojapampa in the northeast, Cuzco in the east and Mocegua in the south. It lasted more than a minute (according to other sources, up to 2 minutes).\r\n<p>At Nasca, a third of the buildings collapsed completely. The settlements of Acari and Jaqui were left in ruins. Only modern buildings remained standing at Caravelli. Buildings suffered damage at Ica, Pisco, Chincha, Coracora, Huancapi, Chala and Arequipa. At Chala, some residents could not remain standing.\r\n</p><p>A number of avalanches occurred, which blocked the roads leading to the interior, especially near Puquio and in other places on the western slopes of the Andes, and also northwest of Cangallo settlement on the eastern slope. The rocky slopes of Calpa Mountain in the Caravelli district cracked. A section of coast in San Juan Bay rose, as a result of which, a cutwater dried up to 1 m.\r\n</p><p>Many recurrent shocks were felt for 24 hours at Nasca and Lomas.\r\n</p><p>At Lomas, the sea retreated 200 m and then flooded the settlement, destroying moorages and customs warehouses. <b>Several people were injured</b>.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)\r\n</p><p>Magnitude 8.6.

A United Press report stated that least 22 persons were killed and 50 injured when a severe earthquake rocked the towns of Nazca and Ica. The center of the temblor apparently was at Nazca, an inland town about 300 miles southeast of Lima. Most of the casualties were reported at Nazca,while two deaths were reported at Ica, about 175 miles south of Lima. A third of the village of Nazca was said to have been leveled and power facilities were disrupted. Earlier in the evening a strong tremor lasting about two minutes was reported felt at Lima, but caused no damage or casualties. Twenty-fours after the first shock, minor shock were still felt at Nazca and Puerto Loma causing nervous inhabitants to flee to open spaces. The U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey reports an earthquake at 22h50m7 U.T., with provsional epicenter at 14.5 S, 75.5 W. Depth is uncertain--probably 50 to 100 km. (reference #8201)</p>",

It was felt almost everywhere in the central and western parts of the country. The number of <b>homes destroyed directly by the earthquake was 2,598; 1,443 people\r\ndied</b>. In addition, <b>1,451 homes were washed away by the ensuing tsunami waves</b>.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake caused great changes in relief. According to repeated geodetic surveys and other data, the southern prominences of Shikoku Island and the Kii Peninsula (Capes Ashizuri, Fluroto, Shionomisaki), rose 1/2 to 1 m, while the bulk of Shikoku Island and the Kii Peninsula, including the bays on the Pacific coast dropped several tens of centimeters. In addition, Shikoku Island and the Kii Peninsula shifted seaward 1/2 to 2 m. Slow vertical movements of opposite sign had been observed for several decades before the earthquake. After the earthquake, they revived and had great speed, but gradually slowed down to the previous rate.\r\n</p><p>One of the nodal planes of the mechanism of the focus of the earthquake was almost vertical and parallel to the coast, the other was almost horizontal. It is assumed that the earthquake could have been caused by a gently sloping overthrust of the insular flank onto the oceanic flank.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake was accompanied by a series of aftershocks, but there were not very many. The zone of the epicenters of the aftershocks, and possibly the source of the earthquake in general, were smaller than the source of the tsunami and the zone of noticeable change in relief,\r\nwhich had a length of 300 km. The causes of this discrepancy have so far not been elucidated.\r\n</p><p>A sizable tsunami rolled onto the coast of the Kii Peninsula and Shikoku Island.

Ben-Menahem (1978) estimated Mw 7.3 based on analysis of teleseismic surface waves. Gutenberg (1955b) estimated ML7.7. The current US Geological Survey catalog estimate is Mw7.5. Our preferred epicenter is 34.977N, 119.033W (Gutenberg 1955a; Ishida and Kanamori 1980; Felzer 2013; Hutton et al. 2010; Hutton, pers. comm. 2016; see electronic supplement for details).\r\n</p><p>Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the 1952 earthquake was purely tectonic in origin, the proximity of the rupture zone for this event to the producing reservoir and the short time lapse between onset of deep production and the occurrence of the 1952 earthquake (98 days) supports the hypothesis that this event was triggered by stress changes associated with oil production.</p>",

The earthquake was accompanied by numerous secondary shocks.</p><p>The point on the coast nearest to the epicenter (Kamchatka, Cape Shipunsky) is 140 km. distant. The distance to Petropavlovsk-on-Kamchatka is 200 km. and to Severo-Kuril&#39;sk about 350 km. Thanks to the distance of the epicenter from the coast and the shallow depth of the focus, the earthquake was not accompanied by significant destruction. As a result of a survey of damage to buildings and installations it was established that on the Kuril-Kamchatka coasts the force of the earthquake did not exceed intensity 7; for Petropavlovsk the force of the quake reached intensity 6; farther south it was somewhat greater (intensity 7). North of Petropavlovsk the intensity of the earthquake was weaker. At Ust&#39;Kamchatsk the force of the quake was of intensity 5. From the Kronotsky Peninsula to the northern Kuril Islands there was damage to structures, destruction of stoves and chimneys, and so on. Buildings and structures in Petropavlovsk and its surroundings suffered comparatively little.</p><p>The considerable extent of the epicentral zone along the Kamchatka coast is testified to by the fact that the force of the earthquake of 4-5 November varied comparatively little over an extent of almost 700 km, with a shallow depth of focus.</p><p>The earthquake was accompanied by a large number of secondary shocks, the frequency and force of which gradually lessened. From 4-10 November the Petropavlovsk seismological station detected 507 secondary shocks; many of them were also detected by the majority of seismological station of the USSR.</p><p>The greatest destruction and suffering of 4-5 November were caused by the tsunami which arose as a result of the earthquake and which took in about 700 km of the east coasts of Kamchatka and the Kuril Is. On the average the height of the waves on the coast reached 6-7 m.</p><p>Weaker waves were detected all over the Pacific basin.</p><p>(above from reference #4252)</p><p>1952, Nov 4, 16:58:22 UTC. 52.3 N, 161 E, magnitude 8.5, intensity IX.

(reference #10476)</p><p>Present day estimates based on the existed data on population density in the area and available damage reports from some selected coastal locations show that minimum number of victims was about 4000 people with estimated maximum as high as 14000 fatalities (Smyshlyaev, 2003). Based on this, the most realistic estimate for the fatality level can be adopted as 10,000 people, the majority of which (more than 99%) were killed by tsunami. (reference #11763)</p><p>The source of 1952 earthquake was located in two time zones. According to Greenwich (UTC), the earthquake happened on November 4 at 16 hours 58 minutes. In Kamchatka (&#43;12 hours) at this time was November 5, 4-58 am, and in Kuril Islands, which live in Sakhalin time (&#43;11 hours) was 3-58 am.

Prince William Sound, Alaska. This great earthquake and ensuing tsunami took 125 lives (tsunami 110, earthquake 15), and caused about $311 million in property loss. Earthquake effects were heavy in many towns, including Anchorage, Chitina, Glennallen, Homer, Hope, Kasilof, Kenai, Kodiak, Moose Pass, Portage, Seldovia, Seward, Sterling, Valdez, Wasilla, and Whittier. <p>Anchorage, about 120 km northwest of the epicenter, sustained the most severe damage to property. About 30 blocks of dwellings and commercial buildings were damaged or destroyed in the downtown area. The J.C. Penney Company building was damaged beyond repair; the Four Seasons apartment building, a new six-story structure, collapsed; and many other multistory buildings were damaged\r\nheavily. The schools in Anchorage were almost devastated. The Government Hill Grade School, sitting astride a huge landslide, was almost a total loss. Anchorage High School and Denali Grade School were damaged severely. Duration of the shock was estimated at 3 minutes. \r\n</p><p>Landslides in Anchorage caused heavy damage. Huge slides occurred in the downtown business section, at Government Hill, and at Turnagain Heights. The largest and most devastating landslide occurred at Turnagain Heights. An area of about 130 acres was devastated by displacements that broke the ground into many deranged blocks that were collapsed and tilted at all angles. This slide destroyed about 75 private houses. Water mains and gas, sewer, telephone, and electrical systems were disrupted throughout the area. \r\n</p><p>The earthquake was accompanied by vertical displacement over an area of about 520,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The major area of uplift trended northeast from southern Kodiak Island to Prince William Sound and trended east-west to the east of the sound. Vertical displacements ranged from about 11.5 m of uplift to 2.3 m of subsidence relative to sea level. Off the southwest end of Montague Island, there was absolute vertical displacement of about 13-15 m. Uplift also occurred along the extreme southeast coast of Kodiak Island, Sitkalidak Island, and over part or all of Sitkinak Island. This zone of subsidence covered about 285,000 km<sup>2</sup>, including the north and west parts of Prince William Sound, the west part of the Chugach Mountains and a part of the lowlands north of the mountains, most of Kenai Peninsula, and almost all the Kodiak Island group.\r\n</p><p>This great earthquake was felt over a large area of\r\nAlaska and in parts of western Yukon Territory and\r\nBritish Columbia, Canada.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1314:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1964, March 28. 8.4 MS, 9.2 Mw. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #88:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1964, March 28, 03:36:13 UTC. 61.1 N, 147.6 W, depth 20 km, magnitude 8.5 MS. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1250:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1964, March 28. 131 killed, $1020 million damage. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #45:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1964, March 27 17:36:14.2.

The earthquake, caused considerable damage, including the total collapse of an 8-story residential building; 50 lives were lost. In general, we find a large city [Thessaloniki] of 700,000 persons that has been shaken by a magnitude 6.5 earthquake, whose hypocenter is 20 to 30 km away and 22 km deep, to cause a peak recorded acceleration of about 0.159 and the total collapse of one tall (8-story) building from among thousands. Most of the deaths from the earthquake occurred in that one building. The tragedy would have been greater if many residents of the building had not been away on vacation on June 20. In the official report of losses resulting from the June 20 earthquakes, initial loss is estimated to be about $200 million (1978 U.S. dollars), and losses during the first few weeks after the earthquake are estimated to be about $10 million per day. It is not entirely clear whether losses in Thessaloniki Prefecture outside the city were included in these figures. (reference #3662)</p>",

        "comments": "A magnitude 6.1 (Richter) earthquake shook a large area in the Khorasan province in northeast Iran on the afternoon of February 4, 1997. This earthquake was preceded by a foreshock that helped reduce the number of casualties caused by the main excitation. The earthquake epicenter was about 25 km NE of Bojnoord, a city of about 100,000 in the NE part of Khorasan province. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) close to the epicenter was estimated to be about 0.3g. There were several hundred aftershocks; the strongest was a magnitude 5.7 (Richter). Due to this earthquake, 88 people died and more than 173 villages experienced considerable damage. From the observed damage extent, MMI of VIII was assigned to affected areas in the close vicinity of the epicenter (10 km radius).<p>The earthquake epicenter was 37.39 N, 57.35 E. It occurred in the NE part of Iran within the Kopeh-Dagh mountain ranges, which have a general east-west direction. These ranges are bound by the Main Kopeh-Dagh fault at its NE end. The mechanism of this fault is a combination of right lateral strike-slip accompanied by a small component of wide angle reverse movement. Morphological observations are one of the indications of the active status of this fault, and the 1948 earthquake of Eshghabad is strong evidence for this claim. According to the displacements observed along the quaternary faults, ground ruptures along the large historical earthquakes and the occurrence patterns, it can be deduced that many of the geological structures in this area are still active. These structures have formed conjugate faults with general northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest directions.</p><p>Most of the slope instabilities and landslides occurred along steep slopes, road banks, and unprotected river banks within a radius of about 10 km from the earthquake source. Liquefaction was not a big problem in this earthquake because the extent of liquefiable soil layers in this area is negligible.</p><p>Most damage occurred in village adobe houses built on steep slopes of the mountains in the affected area. These houses are inherently heavy and very weak against earthquake forces. In a village within a 10-km radius of the earthquake source, where 100% of the adobe houses had completely collapsed, the town&#39;s only two-story reinforced concrete building survived the earthquake with about 30% induced damage.</p><p>Bojnoord was the only city within range of the strong ground shaking. The reported PGA recorded in the city was about 0.2g. None of the houses or government buildings in this city collapsed in the earthquake, but many of them experienced shear cracks and some minor connection failures. </p><p>The damage and destruction to one-story village houses indicate the presence of higher frequency components in the frequency content of this earthquake. This observation is also explainable with the stiff and rock-like nature of the area&#39;s soil. Preliminary investigations of the main earthquake record and some of its aftershocks show that the ground motions in the area have strong components in the 0.2 to 0.3 sec range. </p><p>Except for the province&#39;s petrochemical facility, located about 15 km from the epicenter, no other lifeline facility was in the general area affected by the earthquake. Although no significant damage occurred in this facility during the earthquake, the operation was halted for several days after the main shock. </p><p>There were a few steel and concrete bridges within the 30 to 40 km radius of the epicenter, but none of them experienced any observable damage. </p><p>(above from reference #1260)</p><p>About 100 people killed, nearly 2,000 injured, about 5,500 houses destroyed and 11,000 houses damaged in the Bojnurd-Shirvan area, Iran. Damage estimated at more than $30 million. Felt in many parts of northeastern Iran, including Esfarayen, Mashhad, Neyshabur, Quchan and Sabzevar. (reference #1053)</p><p>88 killed, 1948 injured.

While Armenia was a less populated city (290,000 inhabitants as opposed to Pereira&#39;s 380,000 inhabitants), the city had clearly been much more affected by the earthquake than Pereira had. Devastation to over 60% of Armenia was evident, with some Sectors of the city, such as the central district, over 90% destroyed. Thousands of people lined the streets in makeshift tents, either having either lost their homes or waiting for their homes to be structurally evaluated. Over 900 people died in the earthquake in the city of Armenia alone. In Pereira, damages were less severe, but upon speaking to city officials and others, we found these individuals felt they had not been &#34;spared&#34; by the effects of the earthquake. In fact, with 45 deaths and approximately 40% of the city&#39;s structures affected, Pereira is now facing the after effects\r\nof a more devastating event than the 1995 Calima-Darien earthquake, which caused the city over US $50 million in damages.

The earthquake was shallow and its epicenter was located at 3.2S, 142.9E, just off-shore and about 90 km west-northwest of Wewak. The strong shaking caused serious damage to numerous houses and water tanks, triggered many landslides and created ground cracks. The collapse of buildings during the strong shaking caused the death of four people and injuries to many others. Uplift of as much as 30-40 cm occurred at the &#34;Wewak Islands&#34;, Tarawai, Walis, Kerasau, Kairiru and Muschu. A moderate tsunami, having maximum amplitude of 3-4 m, was generated at the same time as, or soon after, the earthquake. The focal mechanism of the earthquake may have involved both overthrusting and strike-slip movements, but dominantly the former. The wide separation of the hypocentre and the location of the centroid of the moment tensor solution suggests a large rupture surface. This finding is supported by the great extension (about 180 km) of the aftershock distribution field. The predominantly overthrust focal mechanism for the main earthquake and the approximately east-west orientation of the aftershock distribution :field are consistent with the main pattern of faulting in the east-west trending coastal mountain ranges. Two large aftershocks (magnitude 6) about one week after the main earthquake were located at the western end of the aftershock distribution field. Their normal faulting mechanisms and their locations suggest movement on a northeast trending cross-fault system which terminates the main east-west overthrust (and transcurrent) rupture surface. The tectonic significance of the September 2002 &#34;Wewak Earthquake&#34; is that it represents a major overthrust movement of the leading edge of the India-Australia Plate, contributing to the long history of uplift of the coastal region of northwestern Papua New Guinea.\r\n</p><p>Four people were killed and many were injured during the earthquake shaking. The main cause of deaths and injuries was trauma from collapsing houses.\r\n</p><p>Damage to houses and water tanks was common between the epicentral area and Wewak Town, and probably greatest near the mouth of the Hawain River. Many houses in the villages in the neighbourhood of Wewak, mostly made of bush materials, sustained damage. Many semi-permanent builclings were also damaged and water tanks broken. Houses and water tanks in other towns such as Maprik also sustained damage. Similar damage was reported from the islands Tarawai, Walis, Kerasau, Yuo, Kairiru and Muschu. Damage by the earthquake did not extend to Aitape and Sissano Lagoon.</p><p>In all 873 houses were damaged, some beyond repair. Numerous water tanks were damaged some beyond repair. In addition, a number of bridges and the Wewak Wharf sustained damage. Electricity and water supplies to Wewak Town were also disrupted. Most of the damage occurred at Wewak and immediate neighbourhood, and was related to the earthquake and not the tsunami. The two major aftershocks on the nights of 16 and 17 September caused damage to property in the Aitape area, especially at Yakamul, Pual and Nuku.\r\n</p><p>2002, September 8, 18:44:25.53 UTC. 3.260 South,  142.940 East, depth 13.0 km, 7.6 Mw HRV.

In the region of northern Sumatra and the Nicobar Islands, most of the relative motion of India/Australia and the Eurasia plate is accommodated at the Sunda trench and within several hundred kilometers to the east of the Sunda trench, on the boundaries of the Burma plate. The direction in which India/Australia converges toward Eurasia is oblique to the trend of the Sunda trench. The oblique motion is partitioned into thrust-faulting and strike-slip faulting. The thrust faulting occurs on the interface between the India plate and the western margin of the Burma plate and involves slip directed at a large angle to the orientation of the trench. The strike-slip faulting occurs on the eastern boundary of the Burma plate and involves slip directed approximately parallel to the trench. The 26 December main shock occurred as the result of thrust faulting on the western Burma-plate boundary, but many strike-slip faulting aftershocks occurred on the eastern plate boundary.</p>",

It was felt up to Constantinople, Mesopotamia, Alexandria; considerable areas suffered great losses. Many houses, temples, city walls were destroyed; many people were killed. Destruction was reported from Palestine, Araby and other regions. Underground shocks lasted 40 days and nights (reference #2130).\r\n<p>554, July 11. Constantinople. (reference #521)\r\n</p><p>554, July 9. Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia, Antioch and other cities. (reference #1222)\r\n</p><p>551, Cos. An earthquake and a seismic sea wave, which caused great damage on the island of Cos. The town of Cos was almost completely destroyed, as was all but a small part of the island, and the death toll was heavy. Houses of unbaked brick or mud survived, but most houses, built of stone, were reduced to rubble and drinking water was also polluted by the sea wave. Agathias visited Cos, in the course of a voyage from Alexandria to Constantinople, shortly after the event, and was thus able to see the effects (although of course there may be some exaggeration). His chronology is so confused that the <b>date of the event is uncertain</b>. Agathias says \u0091 at around that time &#39; just after narrating the earthquake of July 551, but in ii. 15 and ii. 16 he regresses four years in his time sequence. Modern authors amalgamate this earthquake with the event of AD 551 that destroyed the Phoenician coast, 800 km away from Cos (McCail 1967, 243).

On the 8th Oct., at 11 A.M., a terrible earthquake occurred in South America. In Valparaiso many buildings were cracked; at lllapel 6 or 8 houses were thrown down and 1 life lost; La Ligua and Petorca were nearly destroyed. The shock was felt at the same moment at points 100 miles distant, and a surface of 10,000 square miles quivered like a leaf.\r\n</p><blockquote><i>Ref #11721</i></blockquote>1847. Terrible  Earthquake. <p>On Friday, the 8th inst., an alarming earthquake occurred here at 11 o&#39;clock in the morning. Its duration was 45 sec in the Port; through the Amandral it was more violent and protracted. The vibrations of the tower of the custom house were perceived with fearful distinctness. It is gratifying to state, however, that no material damage was caused. The walls of some building were cracked; but so far as we can learn none have fallen. The movement was from all accounts as perceptible to persons on board ships in the bay as it was to those on the shore; equally sudden, distinct and disagreeable. A gentleman who was in an English ship of war says the sensation was as if all the guns were coming through the deck. That the motion should thus be distinctly communicated through such depth of water as there is in the bay, is very surprising, it does indeed come through the earth alone. During the remaining part of the day, and the following night, several other shocks occurred. They were slighter and shorter, but still enough to cause alarm; and to induce many families to betake themselves to the street. \r\n</p><p>Much anxiety prevailed to hear from other portions of the country. The first rumors from the neighborhood of Coquimbo were that great destruction had been caused there. It was stated that the town of Illapel had been reduced to complete ruin.  And again that all the finest buildings in Coquimbo itself had been thrown down. This we are happy to find was an exaggeration. Still the shock at lllapel was more violent than it was in this place. Six or eight houses, so says a letter written thence on the 9th inst, were thrown down and one life was lost. As the rumor in regard to Coquimbo have not been confirmed, it is hoped nothing serious occurred there.  In the Capital, Santiago, also, the shock was more powerful than in Valparaiso, and some injury resulted, though it was trifling compared with the fears to which these heavings of nature give rise. What the immediate agency of such inconceivable power may be, is difficult to discover. Here a whole region of country, of ten thousand square miles, is made to quiver like the leaf on a tree, and that on an instant, for the time, so far as it can be ascertained, was almost simultaneous in places a hundred miles distant.</p>",

Following several slight foreshocks on 9 January, reported from al-Hudaida, a destructive earthquake,\r\noccurring around noon local time, affected a large area\r\nof the Yemen. The main shock was felt from al-Darb\r\nin Saudi Arabia to al-Mukalla in Hadramaut, and it was\r\nreported from Assab in Ethiopia, but not from Aden. The region worst affected lies west of Sa&#39;da, in the area round Razih, where a number of villages were destroyed, with small loss of life. Landslides blocked the road at the head of the Razih Valley. To the north, between Jizan and Razih, al Arida near Abu &#39;Arish in Saudi Arabia, the shock caused rockfalls and the drying up ofspringwater. In Sa&#39;da and Rahban, and especially Wadi &#39;Azar, many houses were destroyed: old and new houses cracked in Sa&#39;da, but there was no loss of life. The inhabitants abandoned their homes and camped in tents. In the district of Majz, many Jews were\r\nkilled by the collapse of the roof of their synagogue.\r\nDamage also extended south to Kuhlan and Hajja, where a few houses were demolished.\r\n<p>Aftershocks continued daily up to the second week of March, and added to the damage, though it is not easy to distinguish the effects of individual events. Two strong aftershocks occurred at 09h 18m on 4 February and at 19h 03m on 23 February, of which the former had a magnitude of 5.2, and was reported from Haidan, Khaulan, al-Zahir and Wadi al-&#39;Abidin near Sa&#39;da, where landslides occurred, Damage was also reported from Abu &#39;Arish and Sabiya to the northwest and Harad to the southwest. The aftershock of 23 February was reported from al-Hudaida, Bait al-Faqih, al-Sa&#39;id and Bura&#39;, and is said to have been damaging. It is reported that altogether <b>1200 people were killed</b> and <b>200 injured</b> in these earthquakes, which totally destroyed 300 houses, ruined 400 beyond repair and slightly damaged about 1000.\r\n</p><p>The relocation of the main shock and of the aftershock\r\nof 4 February gives 16.75 N, 43.33 E and 16&#39;90 N, 43.90 E respectively. For neither solution are there any observations from stations between azimuth 90 and 270 degrees, which probably has the effect of dragging the epicentres northwards by possibly as much as half a\r\ndegree, although these positions are quite consistent with\r\nthe rather patchy macroseismic data available.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #3845)</p>",

In many places, which are not specified, earthquakes caused the earth to open up and slat water appeared in the fissures, while elsewhere the sea overwhelmed many towns.\r\n<p>These events took place during the consulship of Gallienus and Fausianus, and Ephesus may have been among the cities which were affected, since its temple and library were destroyed at about this time, although this may have been due to a Scythian invasion (Karwiese 1985, 126).\r\n</p><p>Trebellius provides most of the available information for these earthquakes, although Karwiese indicates the destruction of the temple and library at Ephesus, which, he claims can be dated from ceramics found in the vicinity to the second half of the this century. He also states that this destruction was not necessarily caused by an earthquake, since Scythians were destroying the area of Asia up to Cappadocia, Pession and Ephesus at this time (Zos, I, xxviii, 1). \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #9116)\r\n</p><p>AD 262. Libya. Strong earthquakes caused considerable damage in Libya in the fifth consulship of Gallienus, with Faustinus (i.e. AD 262). It is possible, but not certain, that the shock primarily affected Cyrenaica, where there is\r\narchaeological evidence of destruction in the city of\r\nCyrene, which was rebuilt with the new name Claudiopolis in 268. Sieberg, without quoting an authority, suggests that this earthquake destroyed the oasis of Siwa in Egypt, 280 km away. (reference #3845)\r\n</p><p>262. From an Anonymous (ref #10478) in Scriptores Historiae Augustae we learn of a disastrous earthquake in Asia Minor under the consulship of Gallienus and Faustinianus. Felt also in Lybia and in Rome (?). Many victims. Sea inundated many towns (Antonopoulos, ref #23, quoting &#34;Gallieni&#34; by Trebellius Pollio).\r\n</p><p>262 AD. South Coasts of Asia Minor (iv?). From Trebellius Pollio we learn that in the consulship of Liciniusb Gallionus desasterous earthquakes occurred in Asia Minor and in Lybia. Many houses collapsed causing a large number of deaths, and in many places large cracks opened into the ground, and clefts were formed. The sea overwhelmed many cities (Gallieni, lib. v, Q 2-6). Trebellius says also that these earthquakes occurred while a great pestilence raged in the east. The pestilence, which is also mentioned by Eusebius (Eccles. History, lib. vii, Q 22) together with the fact that at that time Gallienus was consul, fixes the time of this event in 262 AD. It does not seem certain that these earthquakes happened at the same time in Asia Minor and in Lybia. Nor that the inundations alluded to by Pollio took place in Asia Minor. We were unable to find a more detailed information to these events. (reference #23)</p>",

Myanmar, on the eastern side of this collisional zone, lies east of the boundary between the Indian plate to the west, and the Sunda plate. At the latitude of the March 24 earthquake, the Indian plate moves north-northeast with respect to the Sunda plate at a rate of approximately 45 mm/yr. Most of the differential motion between these two plates in Myanmar is concentrated on the Sagaing fault, which is a major north-striking, right-lateral fault that has a slip rate of approximately 18 mm/yr based on GPS data, and lies almost 400 km west of the March 24 earthquake. Numerous large earthquakes have occurred on the Sagaing fault in the past century, including a M 6.9 event in February 1991, which caused 2 fatalities.\r\n</p><p>Additional deformation caused by the collision between the Indian and Sunda plates extends to the east across Myanmar and into neighboring Thailand and northern Laos. In northeastern Myanmar, the collision is causing internal deformation in the Shan plateau and the Shan-Thai block, which are cut by a series of northeast-striking, left-lateral faults. These include, from south to north, the Mae Chan, Nam Ma, Menxing, Menglian, Nantinghe, Wanding, and Longling faults. The March 24 M 6.8 earthquake occurred in a region of distributed deformation in the Shan-Thai block.

At the latitude of this earthquake, the India plate moves north-northeast with respect to Eurasia at a velocity of approximately 50 mm/yr. While the main boundary between these plates is often mapped approximately 200 km to the west of the November 11 earthquake in the Bay of Bengal, as the northern extension of the Sunda-Andaman subduction zone, a significant component of motion between the plates is accommodated by right lateral slip along the Sagaing Fault in central Myanmar. The November 11 earthquake is consistent with rupture on or close to this structure.\r\n</p><p>Moderate to large earthquakes occur relatively frequently in Myanmar; the region within 250 km of the November 11 earthquake has hosted 8 earthquakes of M 6 or larger over the past 40 years, two of which had magnitudes greater than M 7. The M 6.9 earthquake of January 5, 1991 was located approximately 50 km north of the November 11 earthquake and caused 2 fatalities. Historic major earthquakes in Myanmar include 6 events of M 7 or larger on or near the Sagaing fault in the 26 year period between 1930 and 1956, which together were responsible for over 600 fatalities.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>According to the Relief and Resettlement Department (RRD), 17 people died in the Shwebo earthquake, and 477 pagodas, 485 religious buildings, 199 schools, 81 government offices and 1841 houses in Mandalay and Sagaing Regions were damaged...

The depth and style of faulting in this event are consistent with shortening of the shallow Arabian crust within the Zagros Mountains in response to active convergence between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. Because this event is an intraplate event, occurring almost 300 km south of the main plate boundary, and since the event likely did not break the surface, precise identification of the causative fault is difficult at this time.\r\n</p><p>On a broad scale, the seismotectonics of southern Iran are controlled by active convergence between the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This motion manifests in two ways: subduction in the Makran which stretches from the mouth of the Persian Gulf eastward into Pakistan, and continental collision in the Zagros Mountains, which stretch from the Makran northward into Iraq and Turkey. The April 9 event occurred within the Zagros fold-and-thrust belt - the portion of the Zagros Mountains that border the north shore of the Persian Gulf. At the latitude of the event, convergence rates between Arabia and Eurasia are approximately 30 mm/yr.\r\n</p><p>The Zagros Mountains experience high rates of seismicity, with thrust-type events similar to the April 9 earthquake and right-lateral strike slip events common. Recent thrust-type events as large as M6 have occurred south of the April 9 epicentral area in the Bandar-e-Abbas region. Highly damaging events such as the 2003 M6.6 Bam earthquake occurred outside of the Zagros Mountains, north of the Makran subduction zone, 660 km to the east of the April 9 event. While the Zagros region experiences high rates of seismicity, large (&gt;M7) surface rupturing earthquakes here are rare. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>A powerful earthquake struck close to Iran&#39;s only nuclear power station on Tuesday, killing 30 people and injuring 800 as it devastated small villages, state media reported. The 6.3 magnitude quake totally destroyed one village, a Red Crescent official told the Iranian Students&#39; News Agency (ISNA), but the nearby Bushehr nuclear plant was undamaged, according to a local politician and the Russian company that built it. &#34;Up until now the earthquake has left behind 30 dead and 800 injured,&#34; said Fereydoun Hassanvand, the governor of Bushehr province, according to ISNA. Many houses in rural parts of the province are made of mud brick, which can easily crumble in a quake. Across the Gulf, offices in Qatar and Bahrain were evacuated after the quake, whose epicentre was 89 km (55 miles) southeast of the port of Bushehr, according to the USGS. The early afternoon shock was also felt in financial hub Dubai. (reference #10492)</p>",

A mud volcano caused an island which measured approximately 76 m long, 30 m wide and 18 m high to form in the Arabian Sea about 600 meters off the coast near Gwadar, Pakistan. A tsunami was recorded with the following maximum wave heights: 0.17 m at Chah Bahar and 0.09 m at Jask, Iran; 0.26 m at Muscat, Oman. </p><p><b>Tectonic Summary</b>\r\n</p><p>The September 24, 2013 M7.7 earthquake in south-central Pakistan occurred as the result of oblique-strike-slip type motion at shallow crustal depths. The location and mechanism of the earthquake are consistent with rupture within the Eurasia plate above the Makran subduction zone. The event occurred within the transition zone between northward subduction of the Arabia plate beneath the Eurasia plate and northward collision of the India plate with the Eurasia plate. The epicenter of the event is 69km north of Awaran, Pakistan, and 270km north of Karachi, Pakistan (population 11.6 million). On a broad scale, the tectonics of southern and central Pakistan reflect a complex plate boundary where the India plate slides northward relative to the Eurasia plate in the east, and the Arabia plate subducts northward beneath the Eurasia plate in the Makran. These motions typically result in north-south to northeast-southwest strike-slip motion at the latitude of the September 24 earthquake that is primarily accommodated on the Chaman Fault, with the earthquake potentially occurring on one of the southern-most strands of this fault system.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #10748:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>An earthquake in Pakistan, powerful enough to prompt the appearance of a small island off the coast, has killed at least 330 people, Pakistani officials said. The 7.7-magnitude quake struck Tuesday in a remote, sparsely populated area of southwestern Pakistan, but it had severe consequences. At least 330 people have lost their lives, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority said Wednesday. In addition to fatalities, 445 people were injured, he said. And more people are still feared to be trapped in wreckage. Images from the scene showed some buildings reduced to rubble. </p><p>The quake was strong enough to cause a mass 20-30 feet high to emerge from the Arabian Sea like a small mountain island off the coast of Gwadar, local police official Mozzam Jah said.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #10805:</i></blockquote><p>A total of 46,756 houses have been damaged in the recent earthquake in Balochistan including 32,638 completely and 14,118 partially, says latest data released by National Disaster Management Authority on Wednesday. According to breakup, 12,961 houses have been damaged completely and 6,151 partially in Mashkai. Likewise 411 houses have completely been damaged and 95 partially in Mangoli, 12,422 house damaged completely and 4,792 partially in Awaran, 6,844 houses damaged completely and 3,080 partially in Malar/Dandar.

Geologic development of the region is a consequence of a number of first-order plate tectonic processes that include subduction, large-scale transform faulting, compressional mountain building and crustal extension...\r\n</p><p>Off the south coast of Pakistan and southeast coast of Iran, the Makran trench is the present-day surface expression of active subduction of the Arabia plate beneath the continental Eurasia plate, which converge at a rate of approximately 20 mm/yr. Although the Makran subduction zone has a relatively slow convergence rate, it has produced large devastating earthquakes and tsunamis. For example, the November 27, 1945 M8.0 mega-thrust earthquake produced a tsunami within the Gulf of Oman and Arabia Sea, killing over 4,000 people. Northwest of this active subduction zone, collision of the Arabia and Eurasia plates forms the approximately 1,500-km-long fold and thrust belt of the Zagros Mountains, which crosses the whole of western Iran and extends into northeastern Iraq. Collision of the Arabia and Eurasia plates also causes crustal shortening in the Alborz Mountains and Kopet Dag in northern Iran. Eastern Iran experiences destructive earthquakes that originate on both strike-slip and reverse faults. For example, the 16 September 1978 M7.8 earthquake, along the southwest edge of the Dasht-e-Lut Basin killed at least 15,000 people.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>Tehran (AFP) - A 5.7 magnitude earthquake on the Gulf coast near Iran&#39;s sole nuclear power plant killed eight people and injured 190 on Thursday, emergency response chief Hassan Qadami told state media.\r\n&#34;So far, there are seven dead and 30 injured receiving hospital treatment,&#34; the official IRNA news agency quoted Qadami as saying.\r\nHowever, an official said the temblor had &#34;not created any problem for the activities of the power plant&#34; at Bushehr, where Iran has its Russian-built reactor.\r\nThe quake&#39;s epicentre was near Borazjan, around 60 kilometres (35 miles) from Bushehr.\r\nThe media said the quake had destroyed around 250 homes and businesses, while Dashtestan provincial Governor Alireza Khorani also spoke of damaged houses and electricity pylons.\r\n(reference #10815)</p>",

At the location of this earthquake, approximately 80 km to the east-northeast of the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu, the India plate is converging with Eurasia at a rate of 45 mm/yr towards the north-northeast - a fraction of which (~18 mm/yr) is driving the uplift of the Himalayan mountain range. The May 12, 2015 event is the largest aftershock to date of the M 7.8 April 25, 2015 Nepal earthquake - known as the Gorkha earthquake - which was located 150 km to the west, and which ruptured much of the decoll\u00e9ment between these two earthquakes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as slip over a larger fault area. Events of the size of the May 12, 2015 earthquake are typically about 55x30 km in size (length x width). The April 25, 2015 M 7.8 mainshock had approximate dimensions of ~120x80 km, directed from its hypocenter eastwards, and towards Kathmandu.

The focal mechanism solution for the earthquake indicates rupture occurred on a moderately dipping fault striking either northeast-southwest (right-lateral slip) or east-west (left-lateral slip).\r\n</p><p>The location of the September 10, 2016 earthquake broadly places it in the East African Rift System, a 3,000-km-long Cenozoic age continental rift extending from the Afar triple junction (between the horn of Africa and the Middle East), to western Mozambique. The September 10, 2016 earthquake is consistent with mixed divergent and strike slip setting, and occurred somewhat centrally within that microplate, in an area with little to no recorded earthquakes over the past century.\r\n</p><p>Historically, seismicity in the East African Rift is mainly concentrated along the branches of the rift system. Over the preceding century, only one other earthquake has been recorded within 100 km of the September 10, 2016 earthquake - a M 4.3 event in Lake Victoria in December 2013. Further afield, 22 M6&#43; events have occurred within 500 km of the September 10, 2016 earthquake over the preceding century, most on the Western Branch of the Rift System to the west of today&#39;s earthquake. These include a M 6.6 earthquake in March 1966 near Lake Edward on the Uganda-DRC border. Tanzania&#39;s largest historic earthquake over this time period was a M 7.2 event in July 1919, near Lake Tanganyika in the west of the country. A M 6.8 earthquake near the center of Lake Tanganyika in December 2005 resulted in half a dozen or more fatalities.\r\n</p><p>(above ref #1053)\r\n</p><p>The death toll from Saturday&#39;s earthquake stands at 19 not 17 as earlier reported, officials have revealed.\r\nTwo people who had reportedly died at the weekend had not been counted among the earlier casualties. Regional authorities told The Citizen yesterday that the two were from Bukoba Rural. They have been identified as Lukman Suleiman, a one-month-old baby, from Kashenye Village, and Irene Jackson from Buterankuzi Village. Bukoba Rural council chairman Murshid Ngeze confirmed that the two were not among the 17 who had been reported dead following the earthquake that hit Kagera Region. At least 40 people were injured in Bukoba Rural alone, according to official reports.

This series of earthquakes, in combination with a winter storm, appeared to have triggered an avalanche near Farindola that destroyed a hotel killing 29 and injuring 11.\r\n<p>The January 18, 2017 M 5.7 and M 5.6 earthquakes southwest of Amatrice, Italy, occurred as the result of shallow normal faulting on a NW-SE oriented fault (or faults) in the Central Apennines. The Apennines is a mountain range that runs from the Gulf of Taranto in the south to the southern edge of the Po basin in northern Italy. Geologically, the Apennines is largely an accretionary wedge formed as a consequence of subduction. This region is tectonically and geologically complex, involving subduction of the Adria micro-plate beneath Eurasia and the Apennines from east to west, continental collision between the Eurasia and Nubia (Africa) plates building the Alpine mountain belt further to the north, and the opening of the Tyrrhenian basin to the west (the latter of which is in turn related to Adria subduction and eastward trench migration). The evolution of this system has caused the expression of all different tectonic styles acting at the same time in a broad region surrounding Italy and the central Mediterranean. The January 18, 2017 normal faulting earthquakes are intraplate events, an expression of the east-west extensional tectonics that now dominate along the Apennine belt.\r\n</p><p>The January 18, 2017 earthquakes (09:25 UTC M 5.3; 10:14 UTC M 5.7; 10:25 UTC M 5.6) continue a sequence of damaging earthquakes that include:\r\n</p><p>- The August 24, 2016, M 6.2 central Italy (Amatrice) earthquake, which caused approximately 300 fatalities, and severely damaged the town of Amatrice.\r\n</p><p>- The October 26, 2016, M 6.1 central Italy earthquake, which was itself preceded by several hours by a M 5.5 earthquake. The M 6.1 earthquake resulted in damage to numerous buildings, but no fatalities.\r\n</p><p>- The October 30, 2016, M 6.6 central Italy earthquake, the largest event in the sequence to date. This event caused 20 injuries and left many homeless, and caused extensive damage, including destroying the Basilica of Saint Benedict.\r\n</p><p>(all above ref #1053)\r\n</p><p>Rescue workers on skis reached a four-star spa hotel buried by an avalanche in earthquake-stricken central Italy Thursday, reporting no signs of life as they searched for around 30 people believed trapped inside. Three bodies were recovered as heavy vehicles struggled to get to the scene.\r\nTwo people escaped the devastation at the Hotel Rigopiano, in the mountains of the Gran Sasso range, and called for help, but it took hours for responders to arrive to the remote zone. Days of heavy snowfall had knocked out electricity and phone lines in many central Italian towns and hamlets, compounded by four powerful earthquakes that struck the region on Wednesday. It wasn&#39;t immediately clear which if any of the quakes triggered the avalanche. But firefighters said the sheer violence of the snow slide uprooted trees in its wake and wiped out parts of the hotel, leaving only some structures standing and others down the mountainside... The hotel in the Abruzzo region is about 45 kilometers (30 miles) from the coastal city of Pescara, at an altitude of about 1,200 meters (3,940 feet). The area, which has been buried under snowfall for days, is located in the broad swath of central Italy between Rieti and Teramo that was jolted by Wednesday&#39;s quakes, one of which had a 5.7 magnitude.

A small tsunami was recorded in the Solomon Islands.\r\n<p>The January 22nd, 2017, M 7.9 earthquake west of Panguna, Papua New Guinea, occurred as the result of reverse faulting at an intermediate depth (~150 km) beneath the island of Bougainville (North Solomons). At the location of the earthquake, the Australia plate is converging with and subducting beneath the Pacific plate in an east-northeast direction at a rate of approximately 103 mm/yr. At the location of the earthquake, some researchers consider the edges of the Australia and Pacific plates to be divided into several microplates that take up the overall convergence between Australia and the Pacific, including the Solomon Sea, South Bismarck and Manus microplates local to this event. In this context, the January 22nd event occurred along the boundary between the Solomon Sea microplate and the Pacific plate. The Solomon Sea microplate moves slightly faster and more northeasterly with respect to the Pacific plate (and South Bismarck and Manus microplates) than does the Australia plate due to sea-floor spreading in the Woodlark Basin to the southeast of the January 22nd earthquake, facilitating the classic subduction evident beneath New Britain and New Ireland. Focal mechanism solutions for the January 22nd event indicate the earthquake occurred on a moderately dipping fault striking either northwest or southeast. The location, depth and focal mechanism solution all indicate the earthquake occurred as a result of intraplate faulting within the subducting lithosphere of the Australia plate (Solomon Sea microplate), rather than on the overlying plate interface.</p><p>Earthquakes like this event, with focal depths between 70 and 300 km, are commonly termed &#34;intermediate-depth&#34; earthquakes. Intermediate-depth earthquakes represent deformation within subducted slabs rather than at the shallow plate interface between subducting and overriding tectonic plates. They typically cause less damage on the ground surface above their foci than is the case with similar-magnitude shallow-focus earthquakes, but large intermediate-depth earthquakes may be felt at great distance from their epicenters.\r\n</p><p>The Papua New Guinea region frequently hosts large earthquakes. Over the preceding century, 29 other earthquakes with M 7&#43; occurred within 250 km of the January 22nd event. One of these occurred at intermediate (70-300 km) - the March 1983 M 7.6 earthquake, over 200 km northwest of the January 22nd event - while two others occurred at deep (&gt;300 km) depths. The December 17, 2016, M 7.9 intermediate earthquake occurred just under 300 km to the northwest of the January 22nd earthquake. </p><p>(all above ref #1053)\r\n</p><p>A powerful magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck deep under Papua New Guinea on Sunday, causing damage and blackouts but no tsunami hours after the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued an alert for nearby islands. The mid-afternoon quake struck at a depth of 103 miles beneath the eastern province of Bougainville, where Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands meet in a continuous South Pacific archipelago, said Chris McKee, assistant director of Papua New Guinea Geophysical Observatory in Port Moresby. No casualties were reported. But there was damage in parts of central Bougainville and the major town of Arawa, Aloysius Laukai, manager of New Dawn FM Bougainville radio station, said in an email. The provincial capital of Buka was blacked out and residents of the southern town of Buin were moved to higher ground as a precaution against a potential tsunami, Laukai said. All tsunami warnings were later lifted. (ref #11750)\r\n</p><p>The 7.9 magnitude quake claimed at least two lives, caused a series of landslides, wrecked some roads, and left people homeless.

Focal mechanism solutions indicate that rupture occurred on either a steeply dipping normal fault or a shallowly dipping normal fault, both striking in an approximate NW-SE direction. Slip on a fault of either orientation would accommodate the down-dip extension of the Nazca slab. At the location of the earthquake, the oceanic Nazca plate moves east relative to the South America plate at a rate of about 70 mm/yr, subducting at the Peru-Chile Trench west of the Ecuadoran coast and sinking into the mantle beneath South America. Like most earthquakes of Ecuador and western South America, this event was caused by strains generated by the ongoing subduction process.\r\n</p><p>Earthquakes like this event, with focal depths between 70 and 300 km, are commonly termed &#34;intermediate-depth&#34; earthquakes. Intermediate-depth earthquakes represent deformation within subducted slabs rather than at the shallow plate interface between subducting and overriding tectonic plates. They typically cause less damage on the ground surface above their foci than is the case with similar-magnitude shallow-focus earthquakes, but large intermediate-depth earthquakes may be felt at great distance from their epicenters. &#34;Deep-focus&#34; earthquakes, those with focal depths greater than 300 km, also occur in the subducted Nazca plate farther east from the Peru-Chile Trench, beneath western Brazil and central Argentina. Earthquakes have been reliably located to depths of about 650 km in this region.\r\n</p><p>The Peru-Chile Trench is an area that hosts large earthquakes quite regularly. Within 500 km of the February 22nd earthquake, there have been 15 other intermediate depth earthquakes with magnitudes of 6.5&#43; over the preceding century. Today&#39;s earthquake is the largest of these; another M 7.5 event occurred about 400 km to the south-southeast beneath Peru in September 2005. A M 7.4 earthquake in the Peru-Ecuador border region in July 1971, 80 km to the southwest of the February 22, 2019, event at a depth of 120 km, was previously the largest known intermediate depth earthquakes in Ecuador since 1900. A M 7.1 earthquake about 110 km to the north-northwest of the February 22, 2019 event in August 2010 caused minor damage across Ecuador, including in the coastal city of Guayaquil.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #12374:</i></blockquote>\r\nEcuador: 9 injured, 50 houses damaged\r\n<p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #12382:</i></blockquote>\r\nJudith Vera reported that her father, Eugenio, died of cardiac arrest [in Manabi] when he intended to get safe during the 7.6-magnitude earthquake that shook the country.\r\n<p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #12375:</i></blockquote>\r\nPeru: 5 buildings destroyed, 25 houses damaged.\r\n<p><i>Note: statistics (refs #12374, 12375) of two earthquakes occurring 22 Feb between 10:17 and 10:40 (UTC).

Focal mechanism solutions for the earthquake indicate rupture occurred on a steeply dipping fault as the result of either right lateral slip on a plane striking NW-SE, or as left lateral slip on a plane striking SW-NE. The earthquake was located approximately 150 km northeast of San Andreas Fault - the major plate boundary in the region. At this latitude, the Pacific plate is moving to the northwest with respect to the North America plate at a rate of approximately 48 mm/yr. The location of the earthquake falls within the Eastern California shear zone, a region of distributed faulting associated with motion across the Pacific:North America plate boundary, and an area of high seismic hazard. More detailed studies will be required to precisely identify the causative fault associated with this event. This region of eastern California has hosted numerous moderate sized earthquakes. Over the past 40 years, 8 other M5&#43; earthquakes have occurred within 50 km of the July 4th, 2019 earthquake. The largest of these was a M 5.8 event on September 20, 1995, about 13 km to the west-northwest of today&#39;s event, which was felt strongly in the China Lake-Ridgecrest area, and more broadly from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. As of 1 hour after the event the July 4th, 2019 earthquake has been followed by numerous aftershocks, the largest of which was a M 4.7 earthquake 2 minutes after the M 6.4 event. Most aftershocks align in a SW-NE trend around the M 6.4 earthquake, though some also align on a NW-SE trend. The M 6.4 event was also preceded by a series of very small earthquakes (foreshocks) over the previous hour, including a M 4.0 event about 30 mins earlier.\r\n<p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12460:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>A powerful earthquake jolted Southern California on Thursday, touching off fires, damaging buildings and forcing the evacuation of a hospital in a desert town northeast of Los Angeles, but there were only minor injuries[...]The Kern County Fire Department said it was dealing with &#34;multiple injuries&#34; that it described as minor, two house fires, small brush fires and gas leaks.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12462:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>Authorities aren&#39;t sure if the July 4 Ridgecrest earthquake led to the death of a Pahrump, Nevada man found crushed beneath a vehicle that he apparently was working beneath when it fell off of its jacks[...]Tippetts said that the vehicle falling on top of Ray &#34;may have been caused by recent earthquakes.&#34; So far, no other death has been tied to the Ridgecrest earthquakes.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12522:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>There was very little structural damage, even from the second stronger earthquake of M 7.1, except for the typically vulnerable buildings (e.g. unreinforced masonry structures and mobile homes).

        "comments": "<b>Tectonic Summary</b>\r\n<p>The November 14, 2019, M 7.1 earthquake northwest of Kota Ternate, Indonesia, occurred at a depth of ~45 km on or near the interface between the subducted Halmahera slab and the overlying Sunda plate, in the complex plate boundary region of eastern Indonesia, about 300 km to the west of the major plate boundary between the Sunda and Pacific plates. Faulting mechanism solutions for the event indicate that it activated a reverse faulting structure, with a moderate dip towards either the northwest or the southeast, in line with the general trend of earthquakes in the region. Though the earthquake occurred near the boundary between the Halmahera slab and the Sunda plate, this earthquake is not a traditional plate interface event such as those experienced in other subduction zones, since the Halmahera slab is completely subducted and has no surface expression. Slip on a fault aligned with either nodal plane is thus consistent with the tectonic setting of this event.\r\n</p><p>Tectonics in eastern Indonesia are extremely complex and are dominated by the mostly convergent interactions of the Pacific, Australia, Philippine Sea, and Sunda plates, with some authors labeling the most proximate edge of the Pacific plate here as a separate tectonic block called the Caroline plate. The edges of the Sunda and Australia plates are also often subdivided into smaller tectonic blocks, including the Molucca Sea and Birds Head microplates immediately to the south and east of the November 2019 earthquake, respectively. In this context, the November 2019 event most closely aligns with the boundary between the broader Sunda plate and the Birds Head microplate. At depth beneath this earthquake and the Molucca Sea in general, the inverted-U-shaped Halmahera plate, which has no surface expression, also plays a role in regional tectonics. At the location of the November 14th earthquake, the Sunda and Philippine Sea plates are converging in an east-west direction at a rate of approximately 109 mm/yr.\r\n</p><p>This area of the Molucca Sea frequently hosts moderate to large earthquakes; nearly 110 M 6&#43; events have occurred within 250 km of the November 14, 2019, earthquake over the past half century, seven of which were M 7&#43;. The largest, a M 7.5 event in August 1986, struck along the same microplate boundary structure just 25 km to the northeast of the 2019 event. Another M 7.5 event in January 2007 occurred 60 km to the southwest of today&#39;s event. Despite the large number of events in the region, few have been damaging because of their oceanic setting, though the 2007 event previously mentioned did result in 3 shaking related fatalities and minor damage on the nearby island of Sulawesi.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12550:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in Southeast Minahasa, North Sulawesi, a resident identified as Sintia Lasik died after receiving treatment at the Tombatu community health center (Puskesmas) on Friday early morning. Tombatu Puskesmas head John Munaiseche said she had likely suffered a heart attack from the shock of the earthquake.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12551:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>36 units of lightly damaged buildings[...]Kota Ternate, North Maluku Province: 3 people were slightly injured and 33 buildings were slightly damaged</p>",

An earthquake occurred in Santa (Peru), and the sea receded to within visible range from shore and it remained there for 24 hours, according to an Indian narrator. Then the sea level rose and the waves &#34;rushed and rolled&#34; with such force that three small vessels of 60-100 tons displacement, which were riding at anchor in the open road, were tossed over the hill on which the town was situated. Their hulls were seen in October 1685 by an English traveller (L. Vafer), who also published a story about this event. The town was completely washed away, but later it was rebuilt 5 1/2 km ( 3 miles) from shore and only a solitary sandy hill remains at the former site of the town. The land close to the shore was devastated for a considerable distance. In Lima, the earthquake was quite severe and partially destroyed the town, including public churches and private buildings.

In a note of the priest Kontarini (from Lixuri) it is written that on 9 February in the\r\nevening a very violent earthquake occurred which lasted much time and shook all houses of the island. On 11 February at 2h in the night a very strong earthquake occurred and pulled down many houses in Leukada. The place set apart for women in the church of Evagelistria collapsed.\r\nMany parts of Saint Minas, the tower bell of Sotiros and the wall of Saint Paraskeve were fissured. Large damage occurred in the capital Amaxike. As it results from a memorial tablet in the wall of the Latin church Pantokrator, which was located in the fortress of Leukada and was built by Varbarigo Balbo in 1733, this church was pulled down by the earthquake. In the same note of Kontarini, it is written that at 2h in the night an earthquake occurred and it was near to destroy all houses in Lixuri. The sea rushed in the land and then withdrew. It caused damage in the northern and western part of Cephallonia, mainly in Palike, in Erisos, and in Argostoli. In Zante and Arta the earthquake was felt as very violent and as violent in Patra. The aftershocks lasted till May (Stamatelos, 1870; Machaeras, 1951; Triantaphyllou, 1959; Tsitseles, 1960). This is considered by Stamatelos as the seventh destruction ofLeukada since 1612.

The sea encroached inland on June 3, 1773.\r\n<p>Two volcanoes near the city appeared to boil. Flows of hot water issued from one and flows of burning hot lava issued from the other. Cracks and gaps formed everywhere on the surface. The ground was in continuous motion. \r\n</p><p>This terrible state lasted five days.

Putte&#39;s (1924, ref #4117) book about seismic events gives the following account. In 1773, the capital of Guatemala was completely destroyed by a series of earthquakes, the first of which occurred on June 10. On July 29, a &#34;fatal&#34; earthquake completed the destruction o\u0080 the city. <b>One hundred and twenty persons were killed and 300 injured</b>, even though the population lived in tents because of the continual shocks. The shocks continued for several more months, since the church and the monastery, which remained standing, although greatly damaged on July 29, finally collapsed only on December 13. The pleistoseismic zone was apparently very limited, since the residents who fled from the capital settled at the settlements of San Lucas [14 km west of Guatemala], Micsco [8 km west of Guatemala], Amatitlan, Petapa [15 km south of Guatemala], Pinula [eastern suburb of Guatemala], Tecpan, Escuintla, Villa Nueva [13 km south west of Guatemala], and Chimaltenango [35 km west of Guatemala], which were very close to the former capital.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)\r\n</p><p>June 3, 1773, Guatemala, the earthquake lasted five days.

        "comments": "Within the limits of our seismic chronicle, that is, for six\r\ncenturies or more, no disastrous earthquake ever visited the plain of Calabria until shortly after noon on Feb. 5 [1783]. Then, within two minutes, nearly very town or village within it was reduced to a shapeless heap of ruins.\r\nConsidering that no town in the central area contained so many as six thousand inhabitants, the numbers of deaths in some are unusually great, for example, 3,331 in Bagnara, 2,261 in Polistena, and 2,017 in Casalnuovo. Vivenzio estimates the total loss of life from the earthquakes\r\nalone at 29,451 in Calabria ulteriore (or 67% of the total population) and 5 in Calabria citeriore, but to this number he adds 5,709 who perished from the epidemics that followed. The more recent statistics of A. Grimaldit increase these figures. He gives the numbers killed in Calabria as 9,515 and in the province of Messina\r\nas 630, or altogether 30,145, and of those who died afterwards from the epidemics as 18,876. He estimates that the material damage in Calabria alone amounted to 132,812,500 lire. (reference #516)\r\n<p>All the towns and villages of Calabria were shaken with tremendous violence. Those built on loose detrital foundations were leveled with the ground, while those situated on solid rock, though greatly shaken, for the most part remained standing. On the 28th of March, however, the contrary seemed to be the case. Those on the east of the Apennines suffered less than those on the west. The devastation throughout the &#34;Plain&#34; of Calabria and Sicily was awful. In both regions a subterranean murmuring noise was heard from the shock; in Calabria it seemed to come from the SW. At Scylla (Straits of Messina) a portion of a mountain fell in to the sea (on the night of the 5th), when great damage was done in Sicily by the great sea wave resulting from its fall. Tremendous effects were produced over the surface of Calabria, hills were overthrown and leveled with the plain, chasms opened in the ground and swallowed up people in the moment of their flight, springs dried up, the course of rivers was stopped for a moment, to be renewed immediately after with such violence as to tear away every obstruction. Stromboli, which under ordinary circumstances constantly emits smoke, ceased almost, if not altogether, to do so on this day. Etna and Vesuvius were also perfectly still. The water was unnaturally still and gloomy, like that which often precedes great thunderstorms, and immediately before the shock a heavy, whistling blast of wind was observed.

With the exception of the first great earthquake of Feb. 5, it was the strongest of the series, though some of the early investigators (Grimaldi, Sarconi and Dolomieu) regarded it as the most violent of all. The number of persons killed by this earthquake, according to Grimaldi, was 1,141, of whom 331 died at Borgia, 184 at Girifalco and 75 at Maida. The total no doubt would have been much higher if the inhabitants had not abandoned their houses and lived in tents and other shelters.\r\n<p>During the earthquakes of Feb. 5-7, no serious damage occurred to the north of the isthmus of Catanzaro, nor was there any loss of life. On Mar. 27, however, the epicentre lay within the isthmus. The three towns already referred to were completely destroyed, while, in many other towns and villages (such as S. Floro, Filadelfia, Cortale, etc.), few houses were left fit to live in. The very disastrous area, enclosed within the innermost isoseismal was only 17\r\nmiles long, nearly 7 miles wide, and contained about 90 sq. miles; while the areas included within the disastrous and ruinous isoseismals did not exceed 400 and 2,000 sq. miles, respectively. The area included within the sixth isoseismal, in which the shock was moderate or slight, covered about 86,000 sq. miles, or approximately\r\nthe same as that for the first great earthquake. Both\r\nMercalli and Baratta, however, as well as Sarconi among the earlier writers, state that the earthquake of Mar. 27 disturbed an area notably greater than that of Feb. 5, for, while it was sensible all over Sicily, it was felt, towards the north, in the Basilicata and in the provinces of Otranto, Bari and Terra di Lavoro.\r\n</p><p>At Monteleone, according to Pignataro, the shock lasted for 2 min. and consisted of undulatory, vertical and vorticose movements combined. Near the river Arnato, as Grirnaldi states, the earth was shaken for two minutes with a movement so violent that people were unable to keep on their feet. At Catanzaro, according to De Leone, the vertical blows were so violent that people were jerked from the ground.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #516)\r\n</p><p>March 28, 1783, 00:16 UTC, Borgia, 38 deg 50 min N, 16 deg 30 min E, intensity X.

Within 3/4 of an hour, three terrible shocks and many slighter ones were felt at Almeria. At Albugnol five very violent shocks. The Salinas of the Bay of Rochetta were submerged, and much salt destroyed. Near Albugnol the sea remained quite calm. Commenced with a low subterranean noise. Houses fell or were much injured. Rochetta was for the most part ruined. Castel del Popolo, Bella Villa dell Palma, and Eniz were also destroyed. In Dalias men were buried beneath the ruins and in Feliz a bell fell from the church tower. At Albugnol the heavens were obscured by a dark mist, which resolved itself into a  cloud, whence, in 10 minutes, five terrible flashes of fire (lightning?) issued, and after each flash a shock took place. A strong wind dispersed the clouds, and intense heat set in, which lasted until the 28th, as did also the shock. A mountain in the neighbourhood was cleft, and from the opening a stream of water poured out upon the lower parts of the town. Springs disappeared in some places, and new ones burst forth in others.

There was a strong earthquake in the south of California, accompanied by an &#34;enormous&#34; tsunami in the Santa Barbara Strait (according to other sources, the tsunami was caused not by the first, but by a second, more powerful earthquake at 10:45 local time).\r\n</p><p>The earthquake was preceded by a weaker shock on December 8, which was felt from San Diego as far as the Franciscan Mission of Purisima...\r\n</p><p>The following is known about the earthquake of the 21st. The church of San Fernando was seriously damaged. At Ventura, the church was so heavily damaged that the facade and dome had to be reset. At Santa Barbara, the buildings of the mission and the fort were damaged; recurrent shocks lasted several months; the residents left the settlement and lived in the open air for two or three months. At Santa Inez, the roofs on all structures collapsed; the corner of the church building collapsed. At Purisma, the earthquake lasted 4 minutes and was so strong, that one could only remain standing with difficulty. Fifteen minutes to 30 minutes after the first shock, a second shock occurred. The church collapsed and all one hundred Indian homes and the public kitchen, made of adobe and covered with tiles, crumbled or cracked; several residents were injured. The mission was later rebuilt in another place. In the focal zone (possibly near Santa Barbara), the alluvial ground cracked; new mud volcanoes and asphalt springs appeared.\r\n</p><p>The previous is from reference #415.\r\n</p><p>This major earthquake caused damage in Santa Barbara, Ventura, and northern Los Angeles Counties. One fatality was reported, but many lives were probably saved by a strong foreshock about 15 minutes earlier that sent alarmed residents fleeing from buildings (Ref #542). Trask (Ref #2541) reports that this earthquake occurred in September -- the event has apparently been attributed to September, October, or December (Ref #79). Trask reports that the number of deaths is &#34;variously estimated from thirty to forty-five&#34; and gives a long account of the event.\r\n</p><p>Magnitudes listed:</p><ul><li>7.1 ML (Ref #542)\r\n7.7 Unk (Ref #237)</li></ul>",

Preceded by a foreshock in the\r\nafternoon of 12 May 1844, a destructive earthquake\r\noccurred in the dihistans of Jaushaqan and Quhrud, particularly affecting the region between Chaqadeh, Kamu,\r\nKuskan and Chugan. Chaqadeh was totally destroyed\r\nand only 3 out of its 103 inhabitants survived. In Qamsar\r\nand Quhrud all houses were destroyed or damaged and\r\neven garden walls were levelled with the ground. The old\r\nCaravanserai at Quhrud collapsed killing a number of\r\npeople. Despite the warning of the foreshock, the total loss of life was estimated at 1500. The shock triggered landslides but caused no damage to the two masonry dams downstream of Qamsar and Quhrud, nor did it cause serious damage to Kashan where the minaret of the masjid-i jami was made to lean 2.1 metres between top and base. The earthquake was also felt in Isfahan, without causing any damage except to a small part of the masjid-i jami. Strong aftershocks continued for two weeks. (reference #1117)\r\n<p>May 12, 1844, 17:00 [local time], Kashan, Qohrud, 33.52 N, 51.36 E, magnitude 6.4, intensity VIII, 1500 killed. (reference #3437)\r\n</p><p>May 10-19, 1844 &#61; 1260 A.H.L. Rabi&#39;al-akhir 20-29; Abd al-Rahim Kalantar Zarrabi gives an approximate date of A.H.L. 1260, two hours before sunset, as time of occurrence of a destructive earthquake in Kashan region. Many houses were destroyed but only 1,500 persons were killed in the city and in the villages. Many people were fortunate in living out doors at the time. There was also a warning by a slight foreshock. Adib Sheibani a contemporary writer and poet of Kashan described in verse the destructive extent of this earthquake which occurred in 1260 A.H.L. Rabi&#39;al-akkir 30, and affected surrounding towns and villages south-west of Kashan-Zahrud, Qamser, Kamu, Kushian and Chuka. The last named had only 3 survivors from a population of 103. Aftershocks continued for longer than two weeks (Naraqi 1967, p. 254). The foregoing descriptions by &#39;Abd al-Rahim and Sheibani seem to be in agreement of an earthquake of considerable magnitude at Kashan and are essentially complementary in outlining its effects. There seems good reason then to surmise a severe quake with epicentre at Chuka that extended in its effects to distant areas. (reference #1217)\r\n</p><p>May 12, 1844, Persia, Ispahan, Julpha, Azerbaijan and Irak, intensity III  which corresponds to an earthquake which destroyed towns and devastated districts. (reference #1055)\r\n</p><p>May 12, 1844-An earthquake shock was felt in Isfahan on 12 May 1844 which originated from a damaging earthquake 120 km to the north of the city that ruined the region of Kuhrud (Naraqi, 1966: 254-5; 1969: 20). In Isfahan, the shock caused no damage except to a small part of the Masjid-i Djuma. This monument, already structurally unsound and in need of strengthening well before the earthquake,\r\nwas cracked by the shock and its two minarets were detached from the main body of the edifice. An inscription on the upper frieze of its south iwan gives the year 1261 hijri (1845) in which superficial repairs of the damage were carried out. Perrey confuses the effects of the Kuhrud earthquake with those of the earthquake that happened the\r\nfollowing day in the Khalkhal district, 550 km from Isfahan and he says that the earthquake overturned numerous buildings in the city including the famous mosque of &#39;Joomah&#39; (Perrey, 1845: 1448). This exaggerated description of the damage is repeated by Wilson, (Wilson, 1930: 119). There is absolutely no evidence that Isfahan suffered any damage from the 1844 earthquake except from the cracking of the walls of the Masjid-i Djuma. (reference #1130)</p>",

        "comments": "1862 July 10, 08h 15m, Ghana; M<sub>F</sub> 6.5. The earthquake of 10 July 1862 was a major event. It was preceded by 17 distinct foreshocks during a period of 6 weeks, and almost totally ruined much of the coastal area of Ghana and Togo, as well as the inland areas of Akwapim and south Ashanti. \r\n<p>In Accra the African part of the town sustained the\r\ngreatest amount of damage, but because of the lightweight type of construction only <b>three people were killed</b>. In the European quarters even strongly built stone masonary houses were almost totally destroyed and public buildings were rendered uninhabitable. The forts of St James, Ussher and Christiansborg were shattered and being no longer habitable, they were evacuated. Near Accra the ground opened\r\nup in places, particularly near the Fort of St James where a large crack was formed in the rocks. Damage extended along the coast to the east for more than 260 km, from Winneba in the west to Anecho in Togo in the east. At Gounkovhe, Kewe and Tove Mission the shock was strong enough to uproot and overturn trees and to cause water to slosh out of tanks. Near Agome-Sewe the shock was very violent; the water in\r\nthe nearby Mono river temporarily fell far below its normal level, presumably from slides that blocked its course further upstream. At Agotime and Botoe the shock was equally strong and at Gounkovhe the sea retired a distance of 80 m from the beach compared with the normal daily tidal change of 20 m. To the west of Accra the shock was strongly felt at the Fort of St George, Elmina and Cape Coast but without any\r\ndamage.\r\n</p><p>Contemporary sources make it clear that contrary to some recent reports, there was considerable damage further inland. Damage seems to have been particularly severe in the regions of Akwapim, Asante and in Dahomey where there was considerable concern among the natives of Abomey who responded to the phenomenon with human sacrifices. The earthquake appears to have been comparatively strong further\r\ninland in the region of Si, 750 km north-northwest of Accra in the district of Dedugu where a number of adobe houses were cracked. The shock was widely felt in the Upper Volta and Mali, notably in the regions of Ira of the district of Dedugu, in the region of Molobala in the district of Segu and at Sokolo, a distance of 1200 km from Accra along the Niger. Indeed, if we trust contemporary reports, the shock\r\nwas perceptible at Dakar in Senegal, 2100 km northwest of Accra, and throughout Sierra Leone.\r\n</p><p>Closely spaced aftershocks continued till 15 h, some of them being felt more to the west of Accra, causing additional damage. The strongest later shocks occurred\r\non 11,12,19 and 28 July and also on 10 October. Minor shocks continued well into 1863. The earthquake paralysed commerce in Accra and trading stopped for many months. The town was\r\ngradually rebuilt and the Fort of Christiansborg was\r\nrepaired and modernized into what is known today as\r\nChristiansborg Castle.\r\n</p><p>In general, the lack of details for all areas outside\r\nAccra make it difficult to determine the extent of the\r\nepicentral area. However, the information we have of this event for the coastal region from European sources and the fact that the earthquake was reported from inland areas as far north as Mali and the Upper Volta, indicate a major earthquake, as confirmed by our value M<sub>F</sub>, which is at least 6.5.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1214)</p>",

Many lives were lost, 100 women being crushed in one bath. Extreme weather prevailed causing terrible suffering. At least four slight, but distinct, shocks of earthquakes had been felt in Mashhad during 3 days, but no damage had been done, (The Times, January 21, 1895, p.59). The first shock of an earthquake occurred at Quchan on January 17 and was felt at noon, and in three minutes time the place was in complete ruins. A very great number of persons are said to have perished. In many instances the unfortunate people were burnt to death, but most of them were crushed. Six hundred persons were entombed in the Mosque while engaged in prayer, and another 600 perished in the various baths. The suffering of the survivors, most of whom perished from exposure to intense cold, was terrible. The after spectacle that presented itself was simply one mass of earth and bricks. Not a single building remained; all without exception were leveled to the ground.\r\n<p>A correspondent writes under date of Nashhad January 30: &#34;The journey of 92 miles was as severe as I have ever experienced; the cold was awful, and sleeping in these caravanserais is by no means pleasant...Quchan was reached at 8:15 A.M. on January 23. The spectacle presented was simply one mass of bricks and mortar; without exception every building was leveled to the ground .... The telegraph instruments were smashed and the wires were thrown down for several miles. At the time of the catastrophe great numbers had crowded in from the neighboring villages to sell their wares and many of them have perished. It is difficult to arrive at a correct estimate as to the amount of mortality - but from my interviews with those of the survivors whom I could rely on I am inclined to think that as many as <b>11,000 have perished</b>, though I feel bound to add that <b>one of the consular authorities puts it at a much lower figure</b> .... The shocks still take place occasionally&#34; (The Times, March 15, 1895 p.15b).\r\n</p><p>Jan 17, 08:30 GMT. 37.l N. 58.5 E. (Savarenskii et al 1962). The center of the earthquake appears to have been near Kuchan, a town which has been damaged or destroyed by earthquake several times during the present century, the last occasion being in 1893, when it was completely reduced to ruins. After this the town was rebuilt on the old site, but the houses were made very largely of wood. \r\n</p><p>(above from ref #1217)\r\n</p><p>1895, Jan 17. An earthquake occurred shortly before noon on Jan 17, 1895, in Quchan. The earthquake totally destroyed Quchan and a number of villages in the upper Atrak valley, <b>killing about 1000 people</b>. The earthquake, which was followed by incessant shocks until the next morning, utterly ruined the Imamzadeh of Sultan Ibrahim (which had been repaired after the earthquake of 1893), killing one of its inmates. Public baths, the bazaar, the Customs House, the Governor&#39;s residence, and the post and telegraph offices were destroyed with casualties. With the exception of a few small shanties, almost all the houses, even those rebuilt after 1893 with timber and light roofs, were ruined. Because of the lightness of the building materials, however, and probably because of the foreshock that warned people, the loss of life in Quchan was much less than it would otherwise have been. In all, about 770 people perished, including many from neighbouring villages who happened to be in town.

The low-sensitivity Omori-Bosch seismograph at Quito registered the onset of seismic waves at 9:02, 9:08, 9:25 and 9:40; the second onset was so strong that the pen of the seismograph jumped from the drum.

February 15.--The first shock of the earthquake which caused so much damage and loss of life in the province of Esmeraldas was felt at 10 o&#39;clock on Jan. 31st, the disturbance continuing at short intervals until Feb. 6th. The inhabitants, panic-stricken, abandoned their homes and families and are still living in the open air, fearing a repetition of the shocks. In the neighborhood of Port Limon four small islands disappeared. These islands were inhabited by fishermen, who escaped in small boats, which they were at sea for three days, until the water became sufficiently calm to enable them to reach the mainland. The city of Esmeraldas was nearly inundated by a tidal wave which entered the port, flooding the principal streets. All the inhabitants ran for the mountains in the neighborhood. All the towns in the provinces of Esmeraldas and Manabi were greatly damaged. Most of the inhabitants are homeless.

A number of studies... mention it was accompanied by tsunami waves. This is mistaken. In fact, flooding of a different nature was taken for a tsunami. The original accounts mention the following. </p><p>The earthquake was felt most strongly on the southeast of Sangihe I. It lasted 4 <u>&#43;</u> 2 min and was accompanied by a loud rumble. At Menalu, situated on swampy ground, piles of homes were ripped out of the ground and homes sank to one side or collapsed altogether. People were thrown to the ground. Various structures collapsed at Enemawira, Peta and Tabukan.</p><p>At Tamako, the school and some homes and shops were destroyed. The same occurred at Manganitu, but there was no serious destruction at Kandhar. <b>20 people died.</b> Numerous collapses and rock falls occurred along the entire rocky coast of the island, including the Kandhar region. In Menalu Bay, a chunk 1000 m<sup>3</sup> in volume collapsed into the water from a height of 80 m. To the west of Menalu, a mud flow, which traveled 1 km along the plain, came down from the 80m Endongo hill. 29 homes with <b>117 residents were buried</b> under a mass of earth 1000m long, 700m wide and 6m thick. The loose soil covers on the island were dissected by numerous cracks; water gushed forth from some of them; some areas of the ground subsided. In particular, the Menalu plain subsided; some areas of beach disappeared; here and there the sea wedged into the land in narrow winding branches. As a result of the subsidence of the ground, ground water came to the surface. All this led to the swamping of the plain and the residents of Menalu were obliged to move elsewhere. In Peta Bay, a strip of the south shore 200m long subsided 2m; the top of the bay was also swamped. The coast at Tamako subsided by 1/2m, and an area of coast 180m long subsided 1m at Tabukan. The relief of the sea bottom apparently was unchanged, as all the anchorages continued to function. </p><p>The Endongo mud flow backed up a small river. It overflowed. </p><p>After the earthquake, pouring rain began. The water breached the blockage and flooded the underlying locality. The river at Manganitu overflowed catastrophically, washing out all the bridges.</p><p>The earthquake was less strong on the small islands between the islands of Sulawesi and Mindanao. Nevertheless, on Siau I, people couldn&#39;t remain standing; at many places the ground cracked, avalanches and rockfalls occurred, various brick structures were damaged and some huts sank to one side; <b>one person died and several were injured</b>. There were no reports on the subsidence of sections of the coast.</p><p>On the Talaud I as well, cracks appeared in the ground and water issued from them; public buildings (the kirk, the school, etc.) cracked substantially, there were no victims. One local captain stated that at the same time as the roar, he saw a large elevation form at sea several km to the west of the island.</p><p>The earthquake lasted 1/2 min on the Sarangani Islands, south of Mindanao I; pillars and large trees fell. At Davao, very strong oscillations lasted, according to different estimates, from 2 to 5 min. The cracks which formed in the ground ejected water and sand. People were thrown to the ground.

There was a catastrophic earthquake in the Kanto region. The source of the earthquake, and the moderate tsunami which it generated, included Sagami Gulf and the Boso Peninsula, as well as adjacent areas of the sea and land, and apparently was oriented latitudinally. The assumed length of the source was 150-200 km. </p><p>In the pleistoseismic zone, the earthquake was preceded by an underground roar, like peals of distant thunder. Then began abrupt vertical shocks, which became horizontal oscillations, lasting 6 minutes. People could not remain standing, trees broke or were uprooted. A cloud of smoke was ejected from the Mihara volcano on Oshima Island. \r\n</p><p>The area of destruction included the prefectures of Kanagawa, Tokyo, Chiba, Shizouka and part of Saitama, Yamanashi, and Ibaraki. Homes caught fire at 134 places in Tokyo after the shocks. The enormous conflagration which broke out raged for three days and destroyed three quarters of the city. Fire storms also developed, in one of which, 38,000 people assembled in the city square died. Petroleum storage tanks burst at Yokohama and Yokosuka; the oil spreading on the ground and water took fire; some of the residents who were taking refuge from the earthquake on ships and boats were burned.\r\n</p><p>According to official data, 695,000 homes in Japan suffered damage: 55% of these were burned, 12% collapsed completely, 13% collapsed partly, about 20% suffered seriously from the tremors, and 0.2% were washed away by the tsunami waves. Of the total number of structures, the number of damaged homes was: 86.5% Kanagawa Prefecture, including 96% at Yokohama, and 81% at other places; 48% in Tokyo Prefecture, including 6.3% each in Saitama and Shizouka Prefectures; 3.5% in Yamanashi Prefecture; 0.2% in Ibaraki Prefecture. Brick and stone homes suffered especially, mainly in the foreign quarters. Almost 100,000 people died, and at least 47,000 injured; 2,144 people and 166 were injured in washed away homes. There were many residents of Tokyo who were holidaying on the Pacific Coast among the drowned. The losses amounted to more than 5 billion yen. Many artistic, historical and scientific valuables were lost.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake was accompanied by numerous aftershocks. Forty-four perceptible shocks were felt in the first 12 hours, 88 in the next 12 hours, and 60 and 47 in the next two 12-hour periods.

This earthquake was a result of the displacement of the Tango peninsula block to the northeast and the tilting of the block. The faults, bounding the block on the\r\nsouthwest and the southeast, revived. Along the first of\r\nthese, the Gomura fault, the relative horizontal displacements of the blocks were 250 cm and the vertical ones were 70 cm; along the second, Yamada fault, the vertical displacements were 470 cm and the horizontal ones were 80 cm. The length of the fresh Yamada fault which was traced on land was 7.5 km, that of the Gomura fault (which represents a series of linked smaller faults) was 18 km. However, the latter, as follows from the results of the echo sounding of coastal waters and the distribution of the focuses of the aftershocks of the earthquakes, undoubtedly continued along the sea floor for another 35 km from shore. The displacements of the flanks of the fault were apparently greater on the bottom than on land. Ships off the coast felt a strong seaquake. The passengers on a small boat at Shioe felt like they were being tossed up in the air. The Gomura fault was apparently the main fault of the earthquake, and eyewitnesses related that the Yamada fault was formed after the strong tremors had begun in this locality.\r\n</p><p>The <b>earthquake did great damage</b> in the epicenter zone, which is one of the centers of the silk weaving industry of the country; about <b>3,000 people died</b>. It seems that Mineyama suffered especially. Here, 988 out of 998 homes completely collapsed or burned down; <b>1,122 people died</b>. Sixteen fires broke out in the city in the first 10 minutes after the earthquake.\r\n</p><p>According to fishermen, at Mizu (6.5 km northeast of the Gomura fault), 2.5 hours before the earthquake, the sea level dropped 1.2-1.5 m and the bottom of the harbor was partly exposed. This situation lasted until the earthquake. At Shioe (4.5 km southwest of the fault), fishermen noted a small rise of water, about 15 cm, less than 30 minutes\r\nbefore the earthquake. At Tsuiyama, according to a tide gauge record, the sea level was 4-6 cm higher than usual on the day of the earthquake, possibly, however because of a strong northeastern wind.\r\n</p><p>After the earthquake, different parts of the coast rose and fell in accordance with the general nature of the tectonic movements. West of the Gomura fault, the shore rose 80 to 20 cm on a 9 km stretch while it rose only 10-15 cm east of the fault. At Tsuiyarna, the tide gauge record\r\nshowed that the shore rose 5 cm immediately after the start of the earthquake.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake apparently caused a small tsunami, which was observed in the region of the Gomura Fault.\r\n</p><p>Table 51. 3017 dead, 3295 injured, 5 lost. 10633 homes completely destroyed, 9821 homes partly destroyed, 4961 burned down.\r\n</p><p>Iida et al.

On April 14 and 18, 1928, earthquakes of magnitude 6.75 originated in southern Bulgaria, resulting in what has been called the most serious earthquake calamity in the history of that country. The epicenter of the earlier shock was near Chirpan, where there was great destruction; that of the latter was somewhat farther west near Popovitsa (Papazli). Faults were produced with maximum throw of 3 to 4 meters. (ref #1006)\r\n</p><p>1928, April 14 to 18  [effects listed with April 14 event]. Intensity XI. Destruction of the towns of Plovdiv, Borisovgrad and Tchirpan and 240 villages. 105 killed, 74,750 houses destroyed, 264000 inhabitants without shelter (of a population of 488,000). Cracks in the ground, rails twisted. According to G. Bontcheff, the earthquake was local; its main cause lies in the instability of the masses which are at the base of the valley.

The earthquake was preceded by foreshocks the largest of which occurred on 14 April (09:30, 42.15\u00b0 N, 25.28\u00b0 E, M &#61; 6.8) and it was also destructive. It was followed by many aftershocks the largest of which occurred on 25 April (09:25:, M &#61; 5.7). These earthquakes caused large destructions in Philippoupole, Tsipran and Papasli. In Philippoupole 8,000 houses collapsed. Totally 74,570 houses were overturned in 240 cities and villages. 127 people were killed and 1,735 were injured. During the generation of the earthquake of 14 April (M &#61;6.8), two parallel normal faults were created in the ground with an east-west direction, a distance between them equal to about 15 km and a fall to the south side of the north fault and to the north side of the south fault by about 50 cm. The length of the north fault was equal to 38 km and of the south equal to 42 km. During the generation of the main shock (M &#61; 7.0), the ground rupture was extended more to the west and turned to the northwest. The total length of the rupture which was caused by the main shock was about 60 km while the northeast side of the fault was sunk by more than 3m near the village Popovitsa. In Komotine the earthquake caused the collapse of a house and fissures in walls. In Thessaloniki, it caused panic and fissures in the walls of some houses and of some building in the beach. In the area of Kapoutzidi two houses collapsed. The inhabitants got out of the houses and many of them spent the night in the open air. In Eleutheroupole, the police station collapsed. It was felt in several places of Greece. Some days before the earthquake the mineral springs around Philippoupole overflowed and the water that came out was very warm (Newspaper of Balkans, 19.4.1928; AOA, 1932; Sieberg, 1932b; Montandon, 1953; Richter, 1958). Isoseismals for the largest foreshock, for the main shock and for its largest aftershock are cited in the atlas of UNESCO (Shebalin et al., 1974b) and by Papazachos et al. (1997b).

The\r\ntown of Cotabato suffered most in its buildings; it was certainly the nearest town to the E of the epicentre but the main cause responsible for the numerous ruins was the poor condition of the buildings, most of them badly constructed and the rest old and in bad repair. These conditions were aggravated by the soft and swampy nature of the soil along the river bank. Cotabato was once upon a time\r\na swamp. Only a few sections are solid ground and the rest filled with sand and other light materials. Most of the houses are built over this filling, that is why so many\r\nhouses fell down; whilst, in nearby places where there is firmer ground, light structures withstood the shocks. Up the river, ruins occurred on its banks and in small islets in the swamps and lakes. Its epicentre was located in the NE part of the Celebes Sea. The quake hit Cotabato <b>killing 93 persons</b>; hundreds rendered homeless. The greatest sufferer from the quake was Cotabato where all the old buildings were razed to the ground.

Buildings made of raw brick were destroyed, and almost all collapsed. There was also major damage to the ferro-concrete support framework of the buildings. In the area of Ashkhabad, horizontal deformations in the ground appeared in the form of fissures and gaps... Their width was measured as 1 or several centimeters... In the northern end of Komsomol Street...the width of the cracks reached 0.1 m. Water pipes ruptured in this area.</p><p><strong>Tens of thousands of people were killed and injured</strong> in this earthquake. All the private and public buildings in many of the villages around the city were destroyed, and most of them collapsed. The intensity of the earthquake in the villages of Kara-Tokmak, Kuru-Gaudan, Annau, Kurtli, and others is estimated not less than 9.</p><p>In Kuru-Gaudan, 25 km southeast of Ashkhabad, ...&#34;more than 10 new springs appeared. ... The water level in the wells increased 2 m. A spring to the west of the village quintupled its output.... In the eastern part of the village the water pipes burst; pipes swelled in several places owing to the compression of the ground... Displacements of 90 cm in depth occurred on the tops of hills, on watersheds, and on the peak areas of slopes. Fissures measured up to 60 cm in width&#34;. &#34;The fissures extended hundreds of meters in length.&#34;</p><p>Ye. M. Butovskaya writes about the destruction in Kuru-Gaudan: &#34;The rupture and thrust of one part of a pipeline onto another over a length of 3 m were not uncommon. Waterlines swelled to a height of 1 m; roofs here flung farm cattle sheds to a distance of several meters in a northeast-southwest direction; ... monolith brick columns were sheared in 70 x 80 cm sections.&#34;</p><p>Many reports describe the falling of heavy commodity trains, which were thrown from the railroad tracks in the Ashkhabad region and the Annau station, and some give a detailed engineering analysis of the falling of monuments and brick columns, and the tilting of a large iron-concrete elevator.</p><p>Sump volcanoes formed 4-5 km north-northwest of Ashkhabad and in the Kuru-Gaudan region.</p><p>Surface fissures also formed in the opposite direction of Kuru-Gaudan, 27 km northwest of Ashkhabad. Therefore the surface of the rupture, partially seen on the surface extended no less than 70 km.</p><p>Much destruction occurred in the region of the Iranian cities of Deregez, Khakester, and Kelat. More than 30 villages in this region were reduced to piles of debris under which many people lost their lives. There was a multitude of surface fissures of diverse direction and width. The force of the earthquake at its epicenter is rated at intensity 9-10.</p><p>(above ref #223)</p><p><strong>1948 Oct 5, 20:12:09.31 UTC. 38.084N, 58.364E, \u00a07.15 MW.

Approximately 30% of Esmeraldas (Ecuador) was destroyed, including the children&#39;s department of the hospital, where three children died. In all, <strong>11 persons died and 45 were injured as a result of the earthquake</strong>. Water mains were broken and power transmission lines were damaged. The Esmeraldas-Quito highway collapsed at many places. Many other roads of the country were made impassable by cracks and fallen trees. According to press reports, a <strong>landslide from the slopes of the Andes at Panado village buried a hundred people</strong>. The earthquake was destructive in the cities on the northern coast of the country and was strong from Latacunga to Quito, Ibarra and Tulcan. It was felt at Guayaquil.</p><p>In Colombia, Tumaco suffered most of all. Several old residences and a wooden home for railway workers collapsed. The large brick ovens used for drying pulp collapsed at the sawmills. The brick wall of the new church cracked. The walls of a number of other buildings cracked. The rafters of the roof of the tide gauge box set up at the end of the breakwater (on Del Morro Island) came out of their grooves, the roof collapsed and carried the instrument and the box with it into the water. Pile wooden homes rocked so strongly in a north-south direction, that 8 cm gaps appeared in the ground at the foundations. The corrugated roof of the lower shed was bent in by the collision of two adjacent sheds. The embankments connecting Tumaco Island with adjacent islands crumbled and cracked. Bottles, vases, dishes, cameras, typewriters, etc. fell and broke. Water splashed out of tubs. The telegraph link between Tumaco and La Espriella was out of commission for twenty four hours because of fallen posts. <strong>A resident of the city was injured</strong>. Eyewitnesses between Tumaco and Esmeraldas found it difficult to remain standing. Water gushed out of cracks in the ground on Manglares Cape, and trees fell.</p><p>The earthquake was strong at Pasto, Ipyales, Imuesa, Tuquerres and Sapuyas; it lasted about 40 minutes, but did not cause material damage. At Cali and Pereira, the population was frightened. At Bogota, the pendulums stopped on the clocks at the seismic station.</p><p>Many recurrent shocks were felt at the epicentral zone; the two strongest occurred on January 19 at 9:45 and on February 1. According to geodesic data, the breakwater at Tumaco was shifted 1 cm along the vertical by the earthquake.</p><p>The earthquake gave rise to a tsunami. A launch almost sank at Esmeraldas; <strong>four customs officers died</strong>.

There were some 30 victims, most of whom were crushed beneath rock avalanches; mud houses built on eucalyptus wood frames stood up better than houses built of stone. Major landslides occurred, damaging roads and bridges; a deep fissure, in places 25 ft deep by 3 ft wide with a throw of 6 to 7 ft, formed over a distance of 30 to 40 km along the road from Addis Ababa to Asmara. The epicentral region (between Dessye and Ankober) is situated at the junction of the Ethiopian rift and the main NNW.-SSE. tectonic feature which forms the western limit of the triangular Afar depression. The seismicity of this region, which is considerable, may be related to the many faults and graben found to exist in the eastern part of Ethiopia.

The earthquake destroyed at least 25,000 houses and killed about 2,500 people. The shock, which was felt within an area of a radius of about 360 kilometres, as far as Spain, was followed by a damaging aftershock of Ms &#61; 6.1. The earthquake occurred on a previously unrecognised reverse fault and it was associated with a 35 kilometre long rupture on which the observed overall movement was up dip by about 280 centimetres. Ground motions in the epicentral area were significantly in excess of those anticipated by engineers, particularly in the vertical direction in which ground accelerations were very large.

A relatively small-magnitude earthquake, with an epicenter about 10 km south of Old Cairo, caused a disproportionate amount of damage (estimated at [\u00a3 200 million), and the loss of many lives. The shock was strongly felt and caused sporadic damage and loss of life in the Delta, around Zagazig. Damage extended\r\nthroughout the Faiyum and as far south as Beni Suef\r\nand Minya. The area mostly affected was Cairo\r\n(pop. 14 million), in particular Old Cairo, Bulaq and\r\nthe region to the south, along the west bank of the Nile\r\nto Gerza (Jirza) and El Rauda. In all, 350 buildings\r\ncollapsed completely and 9000 were irreparably damaged,\r\n<b>killing 545 people and injuring 6512</b>. Many of the casualties in Cairo were victims of panic-strieken\r\nstampedes of people rushing from buildings. About 350\r\nschools and 216 mosques were ruined, and about 50,000 people were made homeless. \r\n<p>Much of the destruction was due to the high vulnerability of the aging urban and rural building stock in the region, and to the low standards of construction of modern houses. Properly designed and built engineering structures, high-rise buildings, bridges and dams suffered very little or no damage. Terminal walls at Cairo airport cracked and windows were smashed, but f1ights were unaffected. Telephone and power lines were cut and water mains were wrecked in many regions of Egypt.\r\n</p><p>Many historical monuments suffered different\r\ndegrees of damage, but none collapsed completely.\r\nThus the upper part of one of the minarets of al-Azhar\r\nmosque collapsed and the shaft of the minaret structure\r\nwas damaged. The arch and abutments of the Qausun Gate at al-Megherbelin were badly cracked and the wall under the dome of the Jani Bek mosque in the same district collapsed. Here also part of the minaret of the mosque of al-Hadi al-Yusufi fell, and the wall of the structure was fissured. The shock caused the separation of the minaret from the structure of the mosque of Sultan al-Ghauri, the walls of which were badly cracked. The walls of the Qayitbey mosque were slightly damaged and the first fioor of the mosque of\r\nthe Sabil of Muhammad &#39;Ali collapsed. The roofs and part of the walls of the mosques of al-Tashtushi and al-Fakahani collapsed. The outer walls and internal arches of the mosque of &#39;Arnr b. al-&#39;As in Fustat were badly shattered. Some of the walls of the &#39;Abdin palace were also badly damaged, as were various buildings in the citadel. Ornate finials fell from the upper parts ofmany minarets, causing secondary damage to adjacent houses. Of the pre-Islamic\r\nmonuments, a large block was dislodged from the Great\r\nPyramid at Giza and rolled to the ground, while some\r\nother monuments in Saqqara suffered minor cracking.\r\n</p><p>At a few places near the Nile, at Manshiyat Fadil and\r\nDahshur, the shock caused some localised liquefaction\r\nand triggered small rockfalls from Mt Muqattam.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake was felt in Alexandria, Port Said and southern Israel, and as far south as Asyur, It was followed\r\nby many small aftershocks, some of which caused additional damage and loss of life.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #3845)\r\n</p><p>1992, October 10. 552 deaths and $300.0 million damage.

An earthquake which affected all of Taiwan Island and caused great destruction, was accompanied by tsunami waves, which ran onto the coast of the island in an east-west direction. Almost the entire island was flooded for a distance of more than 120 km (30 leagues). The tremors and tsunami waves lasted 8 hours. The three main cities of the island and 20 villages were first destroyed by the earthquake and then by the tsunami. Retreating, the water left buildings, at best, as piles of debris. Not a single living soul was left. More than 40,000 residents died. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #150:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>1782, May 22. South China Sea. Taiwan strait coast tsunami.

He has found that there is a record of a &#34;serious&#34; tsunami event in 1605 caused by a Magnitude 8 earthquake in the Taiwan Strait fairly close to the Chinese mainland which affected the city of Quanzhou in Fujian Province on the Chinese mainland. The 1605 earthquake has been confirmed from previous academic research. They have also located records of another separate event apparently caused by an earthquake (of possibly substantially less magnitude - M7?) in the Taiwan Strait fairly close to south-western Taiwan in &#34;April to July 1781&#34; which affected the Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung, but the death toll was evidently very much lower than 40,000 people. There are references to people climbing up bamboo to escape, and others being washed away.</p>",

The strongest earthquake since 1916 occurred on the Gazelle Peninsula. It was accompanied by a thunderous roar. Its effects were investigated from the air and by land surveys and by questionnaires sent out by N. Fisher. At Rabaul, strong tremors lasted 2-3 minutes. According to some eyewitnesses, they were preceded by not very strong, nor very prolonged oscillations, but since it was night, it was difficult to establish the nature of the beginning of the oscillations.</p><p>The belt of strongest tremors cut across the peninsula from Ataliklikun Bay in a southeastern direction, on the whole coinciding with the corresponding diagonal trough. At Lamingi, at the upper reaches of the Warangoi River, &amp; at other places in the watershed southwest of the trough, numerous avalanches, collapses, and swellings occurred, mainly in loose weathered volcanic formations &amp; on steep slopes. Many streams were backed up by the resulting dams. In one of the small valleys, a loose layer measuring 400 X 500 m came down from the slope, baring the rocks to a height of 100 m; the resulting dam had a length of 400 m, a width of 14 m and a thickness of 12 m three weeks after the earthquake. After the earthquake, the dams burst; <b>three children died</b> in the resulting streams of water and mud in the Warangoi Valley.</p><p>Numerous cracks appeared in the surface of the ground in the Warangoi Valley. Here and there, mainly at places with a high ground water level, there were water, mud and sand gryphons. A number of new springs appeared which soon dried up. The cracking of the ground was caused both by its compaction, and probably by tectonic dislocations of the buried crystalline base. According to Fisher, the system of faults revived by the earthquake extended in a southeastern direction; the southwestern flank of the system apparently subsided, while the northeastern flank rose. This is indicated by the subsidence, by about 1 m, of the western section of the coast of Ataliklikun Bay, and by the slowing down somewhat of the streams to the northeast of the assumed faultline.\r\n</p><p>In the pleistoseismic zone, 15 European homes and a large number of huts of local residents were seriously damaged. However, only one old wooden frame home collapsed completely, while the others were simply shifted off their foundations, to which they were not firmly attached, and which themselves were weak. In addition, some homes rested on piles which stood unsecured on the ground. <b>A child was killed</b> by a falling beam in one of the homes.\r\n</p><p>Everywhere, reservoirs with water, especially those standing on high props, were smashed or burst in the regions of Rabaul, Kokopo and Beinings. Everywhere, dishes, furniture, etc. were overturned and smashed. In Blanche Bay and on North Coast, many stretches of steep shores, made up of loose material, deposited, in particular, during the volcanic eruptions of 1937, went under water.</p><p>The earthquake was felt in the eastern half of New Britain, over almost all of New Ireland and on the adjacent islands. At Ulamona and Namatanai, the tremors were moderate in force and not as prolonged as at Rabaul; at Talasea and Gasmata, they were weak, while the earthquake was not felt at all at Kavieng and on the Arawe Islands. The high-paint isoseismals, in Fisher&#39;s opinion, were somewhat extended in a northwestern direction.</p><p>The tilt meters installed a month before the earthquake at the Rabaul volcanological observatory registered a marked intensification in the rate of tilts, which stopped immediately after the shock. For several hours after the earthquake, aftershocks up to 5 degrees in intensity were felt at intervals of a few minutes. The frequency and force of the aftershocks then began to abate gradually, but they continued for more than a month.</p><p>The earthquake generated oscillations of the seiche type in Blanche Bay.</p>",

At the location of this earthquake, the Australian Plate moves northeast with respect to the Sunda plate at a velocity of approximately 65 mm/yr.</p><p>On the basis of the currently available fault mechanism information and earthquake depth of 80 km, it is likely that this earthquake occurred within the subducting Australian Plate rather than on the plate interface itself. The recent earthquake was deeper than typical subduction thrust earthquakes that generally occur at depths less than 50 km.</p><p>The subduction zone surrounding the immediate region of this event has not witnessed a megathrust earthquake in the recent past, rupturing last in an earthquake of M 8.5 or larger in 1833. Approximately 350 km to the south, a 250 km section of the plate boundary slipped during an Mw 8.4 earthquake in September 2007, while approximately 300 km to the north, a 350 km section slipped during the Mw 8.7 earthquake of March 2005. In early 2008, the plate boundary updip of today&#39;s earthquake was active in a sequence of Mw 5-6 earthquakes. It is not clear how today&#39;s earthquake is related to the sequence of megathrust subduction zone events on the shallower section of the plate boundary.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p><b>CNN Report</b>\r\n<br />A major earthquake in Indonesia killed at least 75 people Wednesday, according to a Red Cross disaster report, citing an official report from the country&#39;s vice president.\r\nEarlier in the day an official said the quake toll was at least 21, with hundreds more injured. Thousands may be trapped by collapsed buildings and houses, said Rustam Pakaya, the head of Ministry of Health&#39;s crisis center.\r\nHe said 75 people were seriously injured. The quake caused widespread power and phone outages, making it difficult to assess the scope of the damage. It struck at around 5 p.m. local time, about 33 miles (53 kilometers) from Padang, the capital city of West Sumatra. Padang is home to more than 800,000 people. State-run Antara news agency cited Pakaya as saying he had received reports that part of a hospital had collapsed and that people were buried under the debris. \r\nHundreds of houses have been damaged, Wayne Ulrich, the Red Cross disaster management coordinator in Indonesia, told CNN.

Three successive shocks struck Rhodes on 18 Dec 1481, the third of which caused considerable damage to the city, which already suffered from a Turkish siege only a year earlier. This first shock occurred on the sixth hour of the night on 18 of Dec 1481 and caused general panic. People fled their homes to open spaces and to the country outside the city walls. The second shock occurred at about ten on the same night. It was stronger and brought about chaos in Rhodes. The third shock happened a little later and nearly ruined the city of Rhodes. In the city some dwellings collapsed and many needed propping up, while in several places the ground opened up... Considering that travellers ... who passed through Rhodes shortly after the earthquake say nothing about a wholesale destruction, the accounts of damage given by Caoursin, Bosio, Coronelli, Parisoti and Suriano seem to be grossly exaggerated. Their narrative is typical of how the effects of an earthquake became known and exaggerated, not just because they were serious, but primarily to draw theological and political morals from a natural disaster, particularly when the earthquake took place in a large urban centre. It is interesting, perhaps, that there is no mention in the sources of the number of people killed or, indeed, whether there was any loss of life.

The thrust character of faulting, inferred from the modeling of seismic waves radiated by the earthquake source, is a consequence of north-northwest, south-southeast, oriented compressive stress that ultimately is driven by the northward motion of the India plate as it collides with the Eurasia plate at a rate of more than 40 mm/yr. At the longitude of the earthquake epicenter, the principal boundary between these plates is situated in northern India and Pakistan, over 800 km south of the epicenter, but the convergence produces a broad zone of tectonic deformation that extends more than 1000 km north of the principle plate boundary.\r\n\r\nThe tectonics of the epicentral region are complex, and both strike-slip and reverse faulting earthquakes have occurred in the vicinity of the July 19 event. A system of thrust faults has been mapped just to the north of this earthquake, near to the Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan border, and broad piedmont of alluvial fans that bound the southern margin of the Ferghana basin show abundant evidence of Quaternary deformation. Historic earthquakes in the immediate vicinity of the July 19 event have been infrequent, with only three earthquakes of M 5.5 or larger within 100 km in the past 40 years; none of those earthquakes are known to have caused fatalities. Another fault system approximately 100 km to the south, near the southern border of Kyrgyzstan with Tajikistan and China, has been historically more active and an M 5.2 event in 2007, which was about 150 km to the southwest of the July 19 earthquake, caused several fatalities. In 1983, a M 5.9 earthquake 150 km to the southeast caused in 12 fatalities. The largest historic event in the region, a M 7.4 earthquake in August 1974, was located approximately 220 km to the east-southeast of the July 19 epicenter. This large earthquake was located close to the epicenter of a M 6.6 earthquake that occurred in October 2008.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)</p>",

At the latitude of the September 18 earthquake, the India plate converges with Eurasia at a rate of approximately 46 mm/yr towards the north-northeast. The broad convergence between these two plates has resulted in the uplift of the Himalayas, the world&#39;s tallest mountain range. The preliminary focal mechanism of the earthquake suggests strike slip faulting, and thus an intraplate source within the upper Eurasian plate or the underlying India plate, rather than occurring on the thrust interface plate boundary between the two.\r\n</p><p>This region has experienced relatively moderate seismicity in the past, with 18 earthquakes of M 5 or greater over the past 35 years within 100 km of the epicenter of the September 18 event.

The depth of the event indicates it ruptured a fault within the crust of the Sunda plate, rather than on the deeper subduction zone plate boundary interface. At the latitude of this earthquake, the Philippine Sea plate moves towards the west-northwest with respect to the Sunda plate at a rate of approximately 10 cm/yr, subducting beneath the Philippine Islands several hundred kilometers to the east of the October 15 earthquake at the Philippine Trench. </p><p>(above reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>LOON, Philippines. The earthquake that struck the central Philippines and killed at least 144 people also dealt a serious blow to the region&#39;s historical and religious legacy by heavily damaging a dozen or more churches, some of them hundreds of years old... The bell tower toppled from Cebu city&#39;s 16th-century Basilica of the Holy Child -- a remnant of the Spanish colonial era and the country&#39;s oldest church building -- becoming a pile of rubble in the courtyard by the front gate. Other churches on the neighboring island of Bohol, epicenter of the quake and a popular tourist destination, were also damaged, some beyond repair, while the Bohol seaside town of Loon was a jumble of toppled houses, churches and other buildings. (reference #10761)\r\n</p><p>The quake struck at 8:12 am and was centered about 20 miles below Carmen city, where many small buildings collapsed. Many roads and bridges were reported damaged, making rescue operations difficult. But historic churches dating from the Spanish colonial period suffered the most. Extensive damage also hit densely populated Cebu city, across a narrow strait from Bohol, causing deaths when a building in the port and the roof of a market area collapsed. (reference #10762)\r\n</p><p>Based on the report of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council yesterday morning, the death count hit 186. Out of this total, 173 deaths were reported from Bohol, 12 from Cebu, and one fatality reported from Siquijor. The tally of the number of injured people reached 583 coming from Bohol, Cebu, Siquijor, Iloilo and Negros Occidental. A total of 11 people are still reported missing based on the latest report.

Felt from Tipasa east to Boumerdes.\r\n<p><b>Tectonic Summary</b>\r\n</p><p>Seismotectonics of the Mediterranean Region and Vicinity\r\n</p><p>The Mediterranean region is seismically active due to the northward convergence (4-10 mm/yr) of the African plate with respect to the Eurasian plate along a complex plate boundary. This convergence began approximately 50 Ma and was associated with the closure of the Tethys Sea. The modern day remnant of the Tethys Sea is the Mediterranean Sea. The highest rates of seismicity in the Mediterranean region are found along the Hellenic subduction zone of southern Greece, along the North Anatolian Fault Zone of western Turkey and the Calabrian subduction zone of southern Italy. Local high rates of convergence at the Hellenic subduction zone (35mm/yr) are associated with back-arc spreading throughout Greece and western Turkey above the subducting Mediterranean oceanic crust. Crustal normal faulting throughout this region is a manifestation of extensional tectonics associated with the back-arc spreading. The region of the Marmara Sea is a transition zone between this extensional regime, to the west, and the strike-slip regime of the North Anatolian Fault Zone, to the east. The North Anatolian Fault accommodates much of the right-lateral horizontal motion (23-24 mm/yr) between the Anatolian micro-plate and Eurasian plate as the Anatolian micro-plate is being pushed westward to further accommodate closure of the Mediterranean basin caused by the collision of the African and Arabian plates in southeastern Turkey. Subduction of the Mediterranean Sea floor beneath the Tyrrhenian Sea at the Calabrian subduction zone causes a significant zone of seismicity around Sicily and southern Italy. Active volcanoes are located above intermediate depth earthquakes in the Cyclades of the Aegean Sea and in southern Italy.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>ALGIERS, Algeria -- Algerian officials say six people are dead and 420 injured following an earthquake that shook Algiers Friday morning.

The convergence associated with this subduction process is responsible for the uplift of the Andes Mountains, and for the active volcanic chain present along much of this deformation front. Relative to a fixed South America plate, the Nazca plate moves slightly north of eastwards at a rate varying from approximately 80 mm/yr in the south to approximately 65 mm/yr in the north.

The Apennines is a mountain range that runs from the Gulf of Taranto in the south to the southern edge of the Po basin in northern Italy. Geologically, the Apennines is largely an accretionary wedge formed as a consequence of subduction. This region is tectonically and geologically complex, involving both subduction of the Adria micro-plate beneath Eurasia and the Apennines from east to west, continental collision between the Eurasia and Nubia (Africa) plates building the Alpine mountain belt further to the north, and the opening of the Tyrrhenian basin to the west (the latter of which is in turn related to Adria subduction and eastward trench migration). The October 26, 2016 normal faulting earthquake is an intraplate event, an expression of the east-west extensional tectonics that now dominate along the Apennine belt.\r\n</p><p>The October 26, 2016 event is currently the largest aftershock of the August 24, 2016, M 6.2 central Italy (Amatrice) earthquake, which caused approximately 300 fatalities, and severely damaged the town of Amatrice. </p><p>(above from ref #1053)\r\n</p><p>Authorities scrambled to find housing Thursday for thousands of people displaced by a pair of strong earthquakes that struck the same region of central Italy hit by a deadly quake in August, hoping to prevent a second night for them on the street or in cars. The one-two punch packed by the quakes some two hours apart Wednesday evening meant many people were out of harm&#39;s way before the second, more powerful temblor, which toppled many historic buildings that had survived previous jolts.  But no one was trapped in rubble and there were no reports of serious injuries. The only death in the aftermath was attributed to a heart attack in a 73-year-old man\u0085 Mayors of towns scattered in the mountain region spanning the Umbria and Marche regions say many more homes were rendered uninhabitable, on top of those damaged in the devastating August quake. In the town of Ussita, Mayor Marco Rinaldi said his town had been &#34;devastated,&#34; with up to 80 percent of the houses no longer inhabitable\u0085  Most buildings were intact, showing only cracks. The mayor estimated that two-thirds of the town&#39;s 1,500 houses had sustained some damage (ref #11617)\r\n</p><p>13.088, 42.904 (long, lat). 4.45 (Depth). Mw 5.9. 26 October 2016 19:18:05 UTC.

Also felt at Brisbane, Australia.\r\n<p>The Dec 8, 2016, M 7.8 Solomon Islands earthquake occurred as the result of shallow, slightly oblique reverse faulting on or near the plate boundary between the Australia and Pacific plates. Focal mechanism solutions indicate that rupture occurred on either a northwest or north-south-striking, moderately dipping reverse fault. At the location of the earthquake, the Australia plate subducts beneath the Pacific plate towards the east-northeast at a velocity of about 96 mm/yr. The location, depth, and focal mechanism solutions of the Dec 8th earthquake are consistent with its relation to under-thrusting of the Australia plate beneath the Pacific plate (the northwest-striking plane of the focal mechanism solution). </p><p>The Dec 8th earthquake occurred about 100 km northwest of where the Australia:Pacific plate boundary transitions from thrust to transform tectonics between the New Britain Trench to the northwest and the New Hebrides Trench farther east. A pair of large earthquakes (M 7.6 and M 7.4) occurred in that plate boundary transition region in April 2014. More broadly, the Solomon Islands Arc is very seismically active, with 53 earthquakes of M 6.5&#43; occurring within 250 km of the Dec 8th event over the preceding century. The largest of these was a M 7.9 earthquake about 50 km to the southwest in Oct 1931, near the New Britain Trench. In 1979, a M 7.1 earthquake occurred in an almost identical location (8 km northwest) to the Dec 8, 2016 event. None of these historic earthquakes are known to have caused shaking-related fatalities, likely because of their remote location far from population centers that might be vulnerable to earthquake shaking. (ref #1053)\r\n</p><p>The earthquake caused damage to buildings in Kirakira including homes, a hospital, a church, the World Vision office and cut off the town&#39;s power supply\u0085 Early reports from the National Emergency Operations Centre report that over 3000 people in the provinces of Makira, Malaita and Temotu have been affected by the earthquake, with many homes destroyed. (ref #11698)\r\n</p><p>There are reports of collapsed buildings and landslides it the most affected Makira-Ulawa province. The police said 35 to 40 houses on the island of Makira were damaged, including the police barracks at the provincial capital Kirakira\u0085 Most buildings were reportedly traditional-style houses, ABC said. The quake caused widespread blackouts, knocked out phone systems and even caused the tsunami warning system to go down... School office buildings, a classroom and staff housing of Marou Bay Primary School in West Makira were severely damaged, RadioNz reported. This region has also been affected by several landslides. Destruction was reported in other villages in the Marou Bay area. Pawa Secondary School on Ugi Island has also been damaged. One teacher said a staff house and students&#39; sanitation block have been flattened. (ref #11703)\r\n</p><p> She said she knew of only one reported casualty, a 25-year-old with non-specific injuries. The remoteness of the region and the failure of communications meant it was impossible to know the full extent of any injuries or damage, she said.

        "comments": "The September 5, 2018, M 6.6 earthquake east of Tomakomai, on the island of Hokkaido, Japan, occurred as the result of shallow reverse faulting. Focal mechanism solutions for the earthquake indicate faulting occurred on either a moderately dipping reverse fault striking northwest, or on a shallow-to-moderately dipping fault striking southeast. At the location of this earthquake, the Pacific plate is moving towards the west-northwest at a velocity of about 87 mm/yr relative to the North America plate, subducting beneath Japan and Eurasia at the Japan and Kuril-Kamchatka Trenches to the east of the September 5th earthquake. Given the depth and focal mechanism solutions of this earthquake, the event likely represents rupture of a fault within the North America (upper) plate (or Okhotsk microplate), rather than on the subduction zone plate boundary interface between the Pacific and North America plates, which is at a depth of approximately 100 km at the location of this earthquake. Slip on a fault aligned with either nodal plane of the focal mechanism solution is consistent with this intraplate setting.\r\n<p>This reverse-faulting earthquake occurred in a collisional belt whose tectonics are driven by the convergence of the Pacific, Eurasia and North America plates. Hokkaido is made up of accreted terrain that roughly parallels the plate boundary to the east, and today&#39;s earthquake is located in the Oshima Belt region. Japanese seismic hazard maps indicate this earthquake was located in close proximity to the Nohoro-Kyuryo fault zone, with high hazard and an expected maximum magnitude of M~7.\r\n</p><p>While large earthquakes are common in Japan, and regularly cause damage, few moderate-to-large shallow intraplate earthquakes have occurred in the vicinity of today&#39;s earthquake. Over the preceding century, 70 earthquakes of M 6 or larger have occurred within 250 km of the September 5th earthquake, though only 6 of these occurred at shallow depths beneath Hokkaido. The most recent of these six upper plate events was a M 6.4 earthquake about 100 km to the east of today&#39;s event in January, 1970.\r\n</p><p>(all above from ref #1053)\r\n</p><p>The government said there was damage to Hokkaido Electric&#39;s Tomato-Atsuma plant. (ref #12219)\r\n</p><p>The death toll from a powerful earthquake in northern Japan last week rose to 44, with 660 injured, the government said on Monday, as electricity supply remained short and top automaker Toyota suspended work at most of its assembly plants. About 2,500 people remain in evacuation centres, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, after landslides buried houses and rain at the weekend loosened soil in a further threat to unstable houses. Yoshihide Suga, the top government spokesman, said a team of about 40,000 Self-Defense Force troops, police, firefighters and others were working on clearing debris and other clean-up operations. There were no more missing residents, he said. (ref #12221)\r\n</p><p>41 people have lost their lives, 9 are in critical condition, 672 people injured and are being continuously evaluated for their injuries. About 3,800 landslides have been confirmed (ref #12228)\r\n</p><p>The Hokkaido prefectural government in northern Japan reports this month&#39;s powerful earthquake has caused economic loss exceeding 350 million dollars to the local forestry, agriculture, and fishery industries.

Preliminary focal mechanism solutions for the earthquake indicate faulting occurred as the result of slip on either a moderately dipping plane striking just north of west, or on a moderately dipping plane striking just west of south. At the location of this event, the North America plate converges with the Caribbean plate at a rate of about 20 mm/yr towards the west-southwest. The location and focal mechanism solution for the event are consistent with an intraplate tectonic setting within the lithosphere of the Caribbean plate, rather than on the plate boundary between the two plates. </p><p>The preliminary location of this earthquake is within about 12 km of the January 6, 2020, M 5.8 earthquake. Over the past several weeks, hundreds of small earthquakes have occurred in this same region, beginning in earnest with a M 4.7 earthquake late on December 28 and a M 5.0 event a few hours later. Since the M 4.7 event, over 400 M 2&#43; earthquakes have occurred in this region, 11 of which were M 4&#43;, including today&#39;s M 6.5 event and the January 6th M 5.8. The proximity of these events to Puerto Rico, and their shallow depth, mean that dozens of these events have likely been felt on land, though with the exception of the M 5.8 earthquake and the latest M 6.5, none are likely to have caused significant damage. </p><p>Tectonics in Puerto Rico are dominated by the convergence between the North America and Caribbean plates, with the island being squeezed between the two. To the north of Puerto Rico, North America subducts beneath the Caribbean plate along the Puerto Rico trench. To the south of the island, and south of today&#39;s earthquake, Caribbean plate lithosphere subducts beneath Puerto Rico at the Muertos Trough. The January 6 and 7 earthquakes, and other recent nearby events, are occurring in the offshore deformation zone bound by the Punta Montalva Fault on land and the Guayanilla Canyon offshore.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12628:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>A more modern facility, the privately owned EcoElectrica plant built in 2000, was also damaged during the earthquake.\r\n</p><p><b>Though only one person was directly killed by the earthquake, at least three people have died of apparent heart attacks </b> that may be related to the temblor&#39;s effects, local officials said on Friday.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12591:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez declared a state of emergency on Tuesday after a series of earthquakes killed at least one person, toppled buildings and knocked out power to nearly the entire island of more than 3 million people.

The main shock occurred in Ashvina of the 30th Laukik year (Sept. 1555) in the second watch of the night (4-8h after sunset). It killed many people and caused the ground to open up, confusing route travellers.</p><p>Damage extended to the southeast of the valley of Kashmir, about which little is known, except that the village of Maru Petgam or Mawar in the valley of Marvardan in Uttar Machhipura was completely destroyed by a landslide with the loss of 600 rather than 60000 lives as reported by some later writers.</p><p><i>Ref #12709:</i><br />Suka was not only a contemporary but most probably an eye witness to this calamity. His graphical description (Dutt,I 887; Kaul, 1966) states.: <i>&#34;Houses fell into these holes at night and people, anxious to get out from their houses in the morning, issued by breaking through the roof.&#34;</i></p><p>The Tarikh-e Ferishta (or Gulshan-e Ibrahimi) by Ferishta Muhammad Qasim HinduShah Astarabadi also records this earthquake. This general history of India covering period from 1015 AD to 1607 AD is superior in many ways and considered an important source material. It records that:<i>&#34;In the year 962 H a severe earthquake occurred in Kashmir. Many villages and towns were destroyed. On this occasion the hamlet of Nilu and Adampur situated on this side of the river Bihat with their buildings and trees were being transported and appeared on the other side of the river and the village of Mawar which is situated below the mountain, due to the falling of the mountain over it about six hundred people lost their lives&#34;.</i></p><p>Khwaja Muhammad Azam Deedamari states in Waqiat-e Kashmir: <i>&#34;Houses with their residents were swallowed up by the earth. Few people could save their lives through openings.&#34;</i></p><p>It may be noted that this earthquake is described in the Riijatarangini and six other histories in Persian [language]. Detailed description by several historians amply testify that the earthquake was an important event on account of its severity, destruction and wide [fault] area. As already discussed the date is September 1555 AD and the year 1553 AD according to four Persian sources is not accepted in view of the better reliability of the earliest Sanskrit source viz. the Rajatarangini.</p><p><i>Ref #12710:</i><br />Iyengar and Sharma (1998) assigned maximum intensity XII to the 1555 earthquake, but it is not clear how this intensity was quantified or where it is considered applicable.</p><p><i>Ref #12927:</i><br />1555 September. 34.25 N 74.8 E, Mw 7.6-8. The damaging earthquake appears to have been one of a sequence of events, with a mainshock and numerous aftershocks, that occurred over a period of 7 years starting in 1554 or 1555 shortly after the valley had been annexed by Babur\u2019s son Humayun. The earthquake occurred at around midnight, collapsed many houses in Srinagar and toppling some into the river, and was accompanied by fissuring and ground cracks.</p>",

For the Nile Delta, which was considered to be almost free of earthquakes, this was unprecedented.  The shock was felt throughout Palestine, Arabia, Phoenice and Lebanon as far as Antioch, and was associated with a seismic sea-wave on the coast of Phoenice. Modern writers place the epicentral region of this event offshore from Lebanon. This is due to the bias of information from the more populous coastal region. The data available to us, however, suggest an epicentre in the Jordan rift valley.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref#12645:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>The exact date of this event is doubtful, and still not very clear.\r\nThe earthquake destroyed several cities in Maritima (modern Lebanese coast)\r\nMoreover, there is a 6th/7th century AD source (De Fragmentis Historicis Tuscolanis) added that 101 towns, not named in the source but located in the vicinity of these cities, fell down, and a great myriad of men and animals were killed in them.\r\n</p><p>In Berytus, most of the buildings including the famous structures fell down with the loss of a great number of people under the debris [Agathias Scholasticus]. The Bishop of Beirut (an eyewitness of the earthquake) said that there were <b>30,000 deaths due to the earthquake, except the foreign residences [Antoninus Placentinus]. This figure is probably reasonable for a city that was flourishing to the extent it was called pearl of the Phoenician coast at that time.</b>.\r\n</p><p>The city of Sidon suffered with a large number of deaths [John Malalas].\r\nThe cities of Byblus, Tyrus and Tripolis were also destroyed with their inhabit ants [John Malalas, Antoninus Placentinus, De Fragment is Historicis Tuscolanis, Chronicon pseudo-Dionisyanum]. Tyre was also destroyed with its inhabitants [John Malalas, De Fragment is Historicis Tuscolanis, Chronicon pseudo-Dionisyanum.] A similar fate befell the town of Trieris [Antoninus Placentinus] , modern Shikk\r\n</p><p>The total number of deaths is rather difficult to evaluate. However, as a result of the earthquake side effects (tsunami and fires) we believe that a myriad of people were killed along the Lebanese coast, particularly in Beirut.\r\n</p><p>Location of three new affected sites: these are the island of Aradus (modern Arwad), the towns of Trieris (modern Shikka) and Sarepta (modern Sarfand)\r\n</p><p>Assessment of the average surface-wave magnitude of the earthquake (Ms), to be of the order of 7.1-7.3.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref#9116:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>Damage extended along 100 km of the littoral of Galilee and Phoenice Maritima, where towns and villages on the coast were ruined by two successive earthquakes and the seismic sea wave that followed the first quake.\r\n</p><p>Beirut seems to have been the worst hit. It was badly damaged by the earthquake and a sea wave, but most of the destruction seems to have resulted from the ensuing fire, which apparently raged for two months. Buildings and works of art were lost.\r\n</p><p>In addition to noting that Tripoli and Byblus collapsed, and that at least 30000 people died in Beirut, he mentions that a place called Trianis collapsed in the earthquake.\r\n</p><p>[...]destructive fire in Berytus after the earthquake</p>",

It is said that Aila (Eilat) at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba, was completely destroyed with all but 12 of its inhabitants. In Tabuk, 3 new springs of water appeared at a place called al-Qur, and in Taima the ground was split open... The earthquake was felt at Qadi al-Qura, Khaibar, al-Marwa, Medina... and Wadi al-Safra, Badr and Yanbu, to the SW of Medina. In Sinai, the earthquake was strong enough to cause alarm at the monastery of St. Catherine. There is some archaeological evidence to suggest earthquake damage at the citadel of Amman in Jordan, possibly from this event. The shock was also experienced in Egypt, where Tinnis apparently suffered some damage... Water rose in wells in Egypt and Palestine, and the retreat and return of the sea on the Mediterranean coast of Palestine drowned a large number of people... Paleoseismic data suggest that the Aqaba strike-slip fault emerges from the Gulf and appears to cross the 7th-12th-century-AD Islamic walled city of Aila, terminating under the city, indicating repeat movement with the last scarp forming sometime between 1045 and 1278... The occurrence of the seismic sea wave, which can be assumed to have been in the Mediterranean Sea, does not necessarily indicate the epicentral region, but rather the region where there were vulnerable submarine slopes that could produce a flow slide as occurred in the on-land 1202 earthquake and thus does not seem to confirm this... there is some indication that the<b> damage in al-Ramla has been grossly exaggerated, particularly the loss of life, which is estimated in various sources to range from 15000 to as many as 25000 since correspondence between leaders of the Jewish communities in Ramla and Jerusalem appears to include no references to a major calamity in the 1060s</b>.

        "comments": "1509, Sept 10. The earliest information about the earthquake of 10 Sept 1509 in the Sea of Marmara comes from a letter written 5 days after the event, dated 15 Sept 1509, by Nicolo Zustignan a Venetian in Istanbul. His letter reports that the earthquake happened on 10 Sept during the 4th hour of the night. This was a Monday in the Christian calendar and a Tuesday in the Moslem one. The letter says explicitly that the shock felt in Istanbul was also experienced at the same time in other adjacent towns, presumably the towns he refers to in his letter, namely Bursa, Gelibolu and Erdirne, from where news of the effects of the earthquake in Istanbul could have traveled to the capital by land or sea within 5 days. Exactly the same date, day of the week and time of the earthquake are given in contemporary Greek marginal notes. There can be no doubt that the correct date of the earthquake is 10 Sept 1509, at about 10 at night in the New Style (N.S.), and that, from what has already been said the date 14 Sept assigned to the event by most writers is erroneous. Ground shaking in Istanbul was violent and protracted. People could not stay indoors, so they took refuge in open spaces and squares. It is said that shocks continued, with some intermissions, for more than half an hour. The loss of life in Istanbul and its suburbs is difficult to assess. An estimate of 13,000 people killed is reported in the letter sent by the Voyvode of Transylvania to the Doge of Venice, a figure to which most of the occidental chroniclers adhere. Lancelotti (1637) gives 12,000 and Goutoulas (1653) gives 10,000 people killed. A much smaller number, of a few hundred is give by Bugati (1587). Less exaggerated figures are given by contemporary sources, like 1000 by Sofianos (1876a), 1500 by Menavinino (1548), 4000 by Sanuto and 5000 by Rubhi. The mostly likely estimate would be between 1500 and 5000 people. The number of those injured is put at 10,000. (reference #9116)\r\n<p>1509, Sept 10.

Istanbul, Edirne, Gallipoli (Gelibolu, now), Corum and other cities were damaged. Buildings, towers and the coast walls in Istanbul were razed to the ground, the sultan&#39;s castle shook with such force that 5 towers, that had been erected at great expense and where jewellery was kept, collapsed. 1,700 houses collapsed in the city, 13,000 inhabitants were killed.

There is no mention of fissures in the ground or of craterlets, and the aftershock sequence cannot have been as alarming as in 1570. Combining these data with the late arrival of the tsunami lends to the assumption of an offshore epicenter located about 100 km. from Concepcion. The magnitude of the\r\nearthquake may have been in the neighborhood of 8. (reference #252)\r\n</p><p>March 15, 1657, 23:30 UTC, 36.83 S, 73.030 W, magnitude 8 MS, intensity XI, tsunami, casualties.

Early in the morning of Sunday 28 Jumada II, 1133, a major earthquake (37.9N, 46.7E, magnitude 7.7) shook the region of Tabriz, killing at least 40000 people. In Tabriz itself the shock ruined about three quarters of the houses and caused substantial damage to most of the larger buildings which did not, however, collapse. Detailed information about the extent of the affected region outside Tabriz is lacking, but internal evidence suggests that the heaviest destruction, accounting for the large number of casualties, occurred within a zone that extended from near Tabriz to the southeast, through Shibli and beyond Qareh Baba. The shock triggered many rockfalls and was associated\r\nwith a fault break that extended for at least fifty kilometres, from Takmeh Dash to near Tabriz. The break\r\nthrough Shibli was still visible in 1809, and parts of the\r\nfault trace that seems to be connected with this earthquake\r\ncan be seen today on the ground. The shock seems also to have been strongly felt in the Qazvin region and was followed by many strong aftershocks. (reference #1117)\r\n<p>April 26, 1721 &#61; 1133 A.H.L.

The inhabitants dressed and hurried into the streets. Then followed three less severe tremors. But at 04:45 [local time] on July 8, 1730, the area was struck by a shock so severe that people found it difficult to remain standing. A large part of the city was completely destroyed and clouds of dust arose from the ruins. Since the people had time to flee into the streets, only<b> two women perished</b>. Between 12:00 and 13:00 [local time] there was another earthquake, almost equal in force to the previous one. Innumerable tremors continued during the next two days, and with diminished frequency over several months.\r\n</p><p>This was one of the most severe earthquakes in the history of Chile. Severe damage occurred approximately between 30<sup>o</sup> and 36<sup>o</sup> S., from La Serena to Chillan.\r\n</p><p>In La Serena, the parish church was destroyed. In Coquimbo, several houses and churches were slightly damaged. The destructive effects of the earthquake were more apparent in the area north of La Serena, but it is difficult to estimate the northern boundary of the effect of the earthquake because that section of the country was not settled at the time. In Chillan, the damage was less than in La Serena, although several buildings were destroyed and the earthquake greatly frightened the inhabitants. In Valparaiso, some houses were ruined, not only in the low areas, but also on the slopes - something that did not occur even during the earthquake of 1906. Only the house of the governor was saved, although it too was damaged, as well as the arsenal and one auxiliary building. Coquimbo and the mountain villages of Illapel, Petorca and Tiltil were seriously damaged. In the mines the machinery for crushing ore broke down. Strong shocks were also felt in Concepcion but they did not cause any destruction. In Rengo, the church was destroyed. The earthquake was strongly felt as well in three mountain provinces of Argentina, where it terrified the inhabitants of Cordoba. The source of the earthquake was probably located close to the mouth of the Aconcagua River.\r\n</p><p>A destructive tsunami, which enveloped the coast for a distance of over 1000 km, occurred almost simultaneously with the second earthquake. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #11799:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>The earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Metropolitan Chile on July 8th 1730 at 4:30 am local time, have been recognized as the largest to occur in this region since the beginning of written history [Montessus de Ballore, 1912]. The event was preceded by a strong foreshock, which although produced a tsunami that was observed in Concepci\u00f3n, its effects were not as large as those reported for the main shock [Urbina et al., 2016]. </p><p>The shaking produced by the 1730 earthquake caused severe damage to buildings along &gt;1000 km of the coast, from Copiap\u00f3 (30\u00b0S) to Concepci\u00f3n (36.6\u00b0S) Severe damage to buildings was also reported on the other side of the Andes, in Mendoza, Argentina. </p><p>The historical observations at Valpara\u00edso and Penco suggest that the magnitude for the 1730 earthquake was in the range of Mw 9.1-9.3. This estimate is in agreement with the tsunami heights observed in Japan in 1730, which indicate an overall tsunami size consistent with instrumentally recorded Chilean earthquakes of magnitudes of about Mw 9.3.\r\n</p><p>Origin times and magnitudes: </p><ul><li>July 8 4:45 am [local time], mag. 8.75 (ref #252)\r\nJuly 8 4:45 am [local time] (ref #415)\r\nJuly 8 09:00 UTC (ref #79)\r\nJuly 8 08:45 UTC 32.5S, 71.5W, mag 8.25 (ref #150)\r\nJuly 8 10:00 UTC, 33.050S, 71.63W, mag 8.7 (ref #1206)\r\nJuly 8 13:00 UTC, 32.5S, 71.5W, mag. 8.7 (ref #552)\r\nJuly 8 13:00 UTC, mag. 8.75 (ref #164)\r\nMw 9.1-9.3 (ref #11799)\r\nMw 9.0 (ref #11800)</li></ul>",

It is said that 60 square miles of the Chittagong coast suddenly and permanently subsided during this earthquake, and that Ces-lung-Toom, one of the Mug mountains, entirely disappeared, and another sank so low, that its summit only remained visible. Towns which subsided several cubits were overflowed with water; among others Deep Gong, which was submerged to the depth of 7 cubits. Two volcanoes are said to have opened in the Becta Cunda hills.

At the beginning of the seventh hour of the night, three strong shocks were felt in Cairo with a total duration of about four minutes. People were awakened from their sleep and thrown into turmoil. Many left their homes and fled into the alleys, seeking to escape into the open country. In the morning, everyone discussed what had happened. Some walls and old houses collapsed in the shock; other walls were fissured and the minaret of Basus fell, as well as half the minaret of Umm Akhnan (Umm Khunan) in Minufiyya. During the late afternoon, there was another earthquake, which though\r\nweaker than the first, still caused fear and agitation.\r\nMany rumours later circulated that there was going to\r\nbe a further, more destructive shock, but such fears\r\nproved groundless. These effects were produced by a large, probably intermediate-depth event with an epicentre off Crete, where many places were destroyed and many people\r\nkilled. All the other islands in the southern part of the\r\nArchipelago suffered some damage. In Malta, the shock\r\ncaused panic, and widespread minor damage in Valletta,\r\nwhere ships in the harbour were violently shaken.

Of the public buildings, those constructed during the period of Karim Khan-i Zand, such as the bazaar and the Masjid-i Vakil, suffered minor damage. The dome and walls of the Imam zadeh Shah Chiragh, the Madraseh Khan, the Imamzadehs of Shah Mir Hamza and Sa&#39;id Ahmad, as well as part of the palace, collapsed together with several minarets.

Earthquake of the 15th of July of 1853. Account made by an eyewitness: &#34;Cracks opened parallel to the banks of the Manzanares river. The barracks of the infantry, artillery, cavalry, etc., everything fell like in a cavernous collapse, it was impossible to investigate the numbers of soldiers, horses, saddles, and weapons that were buried under the masonry and fell on top of each other. Still, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez, Senior Assistant, asserts that the force never had less than 1000 men, that he had been saved because he left the command to communicate the order to march the troops in the direction of Cumanacoa. Mr. Diego Blanco Zerpa saw the sentinel impelled, without a doubt, by the motion of the earth, take two steps forward and kneel, rifle in hand. This sentinel was found dead in the same place where Blanco Zerpa saw him. He was saved because he jumped into the river, amazed to find its level had risen as a result of the earthquake. A masonry quadrangular prism  was ripped from its base, rotating west to east, fell to the ground with the base upwards and the apex downwards. This prism has a (foot?) of base and three (feet?) of height&#34;.\r\n</p><p>&#34;The sea withdrew from the bay of Puerto Sucre, leaving dry a quarter mile of the riverbed, and then rose to the height of 5 meters and surged onto the shore with a frightful roar, dragging the ships with smaller draw along its path along with the remains of ships lost in ancient times. The dock/pier was ruined.&#34;\r\n</p><p>&#34;The sharp tip of the peninsula called the Dam at the mouth of the Manzaneres River, planted with coconuts, sank, leaving at water level the leaves. (One can calculate the sinking of this peninsula to have been in the order of 15 meters&#34;).    \r\n</p><p>&#34;The victims of this earthquake are more than 1000, as almost everyone who was quartered perished, buried in the rubble of the barracks. Among the civilians were:\r\n<br />At St. Agnes parish: 100 dead.\r\n<br />In the Parish Altagracia: 13 dead.\r\n<br />113 dead.\r\n<br />The injured were numerous&#34;. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #492)</p>",

Undulating oscillations lasted 40-45 sec; their intensity gradually increased, and then just as gradually decreased. All homes in the capital were more or less destroyed. Thick walls cracked, and some collapsed. Heavy tiles fell down from roofs and the streets were full of rubble. The cathedral was heavily damaged; a crack appeared from top to bottom in the facade; the bell towers collapsed; one of the naves was completely destroyed; the roof sagged dangerously. At the town hall, the facade collapsed and <b>people were killed</b>. The Panama-Colon Railway was damaged. The underwater cable to Jamaica was broken. A loud underground rumbling was heard at Gamboa. Barbacoas Port on the Chagres River, Gatun, Chagres, Cruses1 and other settlements in the interior as far as Colon, suffered damage. At Colon (Aspinwall), the railway depot was destroyed; cracks appeared in the ground; there were <b>dead and injured</b>.\r\n<p>In Venezuela, at Riosucio in the valley of the Atrato River, sand and mud volcanoes appeared. A thermal spring appeared on one of the streets at Turbo and almost flooded the city. The populace of these cities fled their homes in panic. The earthquake extended to San Juan del Norte (Nicaragua), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Maracaibo and Caracas (Venezuela), that is, it was felt along the entire northwestern coast of South America.</p><p>It was accompanied by numerous aftershocks.</p><p>Fuchs (ref #2226) adds that the earthquake was felt strongly on the islands in the Gulf of Panama. ...the &#34;Honduras&#34;, situated in a road 3.5 km (2 miles) from Panama, felt a seaquake, preceded by a rumbling. Although no visible waves appeared on the surface, the sea began to move rapidly. The vessel began to move, as if at full speed, and ran aground on a pebble bed.</p><p>Destruction in the city of Panama, several deaths. Also felt on the islands and a tsunami. Cable breaks. Damage suffered the landward towns, even Colon. Felt in Nicaragua to Greytown, North Colombia and Venezuela to Caracas. Seismic wave down to Guayaquil. Numerous, partly final aftershock to 1883.

Furthermore, the intensity data indicate that the event may have been a shallow underthrusting earthquake resulting from plate convergence and that its magnitude was significantly greater than 7... The generation of a significant tsunami by the 7 Sept. 1882 earthquake\r\nwould suggest that a Modified Mercalli intensity of XI was attained in the epicentral area. This would correspond to a magnitude of 8.3, estimated from the maximum observed MM intensity (Io)... (reference #1575)</p>",

Preceded by a strong shock\r\non 20 Oct, an earthquake in the evening of the 8 Jumada I, 1311 devastated Quchan, particularly affecting the populous upper Atrak valley and the sparsely inhabited district of Sar Vilayat. The town of Quchan, already ruined in 1871 and subsequently rebuilt, was utterly destroyed. All public buildings, including the telegraph office, the bazaar with its 1100 shops, part of the mosque and its minarets, the madraseh, caravanserai, and the palace of the Ilkhan, collapsed. All houses and the remnants of the walls of the town were destroyed and at least 5000 people were killed. The dome of the Imamzadeh of Sultan Ibrahim and a few\r\nhouses rebuilt with timber bracing after the 1871 earthquake, were the only structures left standing. In the\r\ntown and its surroundings qanat galleries caved in, producing crevices in the ground 5 to 8 metres deep that added to the destruction. In the Atrak valley all the villages between Yazdanabad, Kalbalasi, Kalukhi and\r\nJartudeh were almost totally destroyed, with an estimated\r\n10000 casualties and the loss of more than 30000 animals. Damage was equally serious in the mountainous region of Kuh-i Muhammad Beg and in the dihistan of Sar Vllayat, as far south as Chakaneh Ulya and Saqi Beg. The number of people killed in this region is not known but the damage was so heavy that a few villages were abandoned. Also, there is some evidence to show that the direct routes to Sabzavar via Chakaneh Sufla and particularly the summer track via Bar had to be abandoned for a year or so...\r\nThe shock was felt all over Turkmenistan and as far as Tehran 640 km away from the epicentral region. It was followed by aftershocks that continued for almost 6 months. On 18 Nov, at night, an aftershock caused serious damage at Katlar and Gabrabad where the mosque collapsed. At dawn on the 19th an even stronger shock... caused great damage to Katlar, Kalukhi and Gabrabad. (ref 1117)\r\n<p>1893, Nov 17. A severe shock was felt on Fri night in the town of Kashan (in fact - Quchan) two thirds of which was destroyed. Mild earthquake shocks continued to be felt in Mashhad and town of (Quchan not Kashan) is reported to be totally wrecked. There has been great lose of life and property, and the supply of food and water is exhausted. Most of the survivors have fled to the mountains. A correspondent who has visited Quchan telegraphs as follows: &#34;Quchan is a heap of ruins, not a house remains standing. Bodies are still being recovered. It is established that the loss of life has been in the proportion of two deaths to every house. The sanitary condition of the place is very bad. Earthquake shocks, preceded by loud reports in the hills to west, continue to be felt only in the town and in the immediate vicinity. The neighboring villages escaped with little damage. Communications are suspended for the time, and the prospects are not encouraging. There is some talk of building a new town to the eastward. A violent earthquake occurred in Khorasan. Two thirds of Bojnurd was completely destroyed and there was a very high mortality with <b>15,000 dead</b>. A severe snow fall followed exceeding half metre in depth. Muay&#39;yed-od Dovlah a personal representative of the Shah, arrived to take charge of relief measures. The city of Mashhad suffered slight damage.

        "comments": "January 12, 1914, 18:29. There was an earthquake connected with an eruption of the Sakurajima volcano and accompanied by a tsunami. In the fall of 1913, at Yoshino, north of Kagoshima, springs, a pond and several wells dried up. On Nov 8 and Dec 9, the Kirishima volcano erupted, The seismic station at Kagoshima registered 91 earthquakes in 1913, compared to a previous annual total of 34.<p>From Jan 9, a swarm of earthquakes began to be registered and felt in the area of the Sakurajima volcano. Five strong shocks were felt on the 10th. Ten were felt on the 11th. The number of shocks registered increased 4-5 times from morning to evening on the 11th. At Kagoshima,  on the 11th, shocks were felt every 20 minutes, every 10 minutes until 3:00 on the 12th, and every 5 minutes from 3:00 to 5:00. Then a pause ensued; at the same time, the underground rumble stopped. Continuous rapid explosions were heard beginning at 9:00. The main explosion occurred at 10:05, and a new crater appeared on the western slope of the volcano. A column of ash rose 9 km, and was then &#34;bent&#34; to the east by the wind. Ten minutes later, a second column of smoke arose on the eastern slope and joined the first. An hour later, the ash began to fall on Kagoshima, but for the most part it fell on the sparsely settled Osumi Peninsula and scattered all over central Japan (it fell on Osaka on the 13th, on Tokyo on the 14th). The depth of the layer of ash was 1 3/4 m near the volcano. The eruption began to abate at 17:00, at about this time, several strong shocks were felt.</p><p>The main earthquake, at 18:29, caused the collapse of homes and dikes at Kagoshima, rock falls and slides. The railway was out of commission for a day, the telegraph line for three days. The collapses buried several refugees. In addition, a tsunami wave 3 m high occurred (according to some sources, 1 1/2 hours after the earthquake), and did serious damage to the boats in the harbor. <b>Thirty-five people died (15 at Kagoshima and 20 at other places) and 112 were injured</b>. \r\n</p><p>At the same time as the earthquake, the gleam of lava was observed in the column of smoke. On the evening of the 13th, a scorching cloud appeared, setting fire to the homes at the foot of the volcano. The volcano was active for a month; new craters were formed; lava poured out, reaching the sea; new islands appeared.</p><p>The lava flow on the western slope of the volcano had a length of more than 5 km and a width of 2-4 km. The heavier eastern flow issued from three pairs of openings, extending in a line. In each pair, the explosion cone was situated on top and the lava issued from below. The strait between the volcano and the Osumi Peninsula, 60 m deep, was filled in with lava, which blocked the strait on February 1. In a month, this tongue rose another 50 m above the water level. </p><p>As a result of the eruption, the geodetic surface of the volcano rose 7 m, while the floor of the bay north of the volcano subsided 3 m. The shore of Kagoshima Bay, which had been rising for 20 years, subsided 1-2 m (several feet). </p><p>The total loss due to these events was estimated at 19 million dollars.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #414)\r\n</p><p>January 12, 1914, 31.5 N, 131 E, 29 deaths, 120 houses destroyed, Sakurijima, eruption; casualties omitted. (reference #1068)\r\n</p><p>63 total deaths. Half or more of the deaths resulted from collapse of stone walls and cliffs, mainly in Kagoshima during the earthquake. Few (6?) deaths on island because of effective evacuation; another 12 buried in landslide that was probably earthquake-induced. Uncertain number killed in building collapses during earthquake. Two people buried by pumice at Fumato. 23 drowned attempting to swim from island. Other estimates of deaths range 23 to 140. Injuries probably totalled 121, but estimates range from 87 to 127.

The damage caused by the shock and the fire that followed was very great: more than 17000 houses were destroyed within a northeast trending zone about 90-km long and 30-km wide defined by Duvar, Yasikoy, Ilyas, Kilinc, Gonen,and Barla. In Burdur, 90% of the houses together with most of the historical monuments and the 20m\r\nhigh clock-tower were destroyed. Kilinc was leveled to the ground and Keciborlu lost 85% of its houses. In Isparta 55% of the houses, the Great Mosque and other public buildings collapsed. Damage and casualties extended to Egridir, Dinar and to other villages within a radius of 60 km. There was damage to the Dinar-Egridir section of the railway line and to many villages as far as Denizli, Bolvadin and Antalya.\r\nAlthough no clear-cut fault displacement has heretofore\r\nbeen documented in association with this event, the permanent submergence of the southeast coast of Lake Burdur for a length of 23 km, reported immediately after the event, suggests that significant surface faulting of a normal nature had occurred along this part of the shore, striking N-45 degrees-E with the northwest (lake) side downthrown by as much as 150cm.

Chillan Earthquake. This earthquake destroyed Chillan and caused great damage in the surrounding towns of the Central Valley, and in the Concepcion area. There were about <b>30,000 dead</b>, chiefly in Chillan and Concepcion. The area of greatest damage was of the order of 45,000 sq km and included the Central Chilean region west of the Andean foothills, between the towns of Linares and Los Angeles. The high number of deaths may partly be attributed to its occurring close to midnight. A survey of damage in Chillan showed that adobe houses were mostly demolished, but other types of construction also suffered important damage; this must be connected with the virtual absence of engineering design or provisions against lateral force. The Coast Range batholith was uplifted by more than 5 feet near the Central Valley margin; but no fault displacement was observed, and the uplift was not visibly connected with known structures. No tsunami and no coastal uplift were described. Apparently there were no changes in level in the Concepcion area. There was no obvious relationship between intensity and surface or subsurface geology. The earthquake was felt throughout the southern part of South America.

With a Mw 6.6, Ms 7.0 (USGS) and intensity VIII, this event is characteristic of the present-day motion on the thrust-fault system. The Uttarkashi earthquake and aftershocks were well recorded at many new seismograph and accelerograph stations established in the Himalayan region under the Himalayan seismicity study programme of DST16. These stations were maintained by IMD, Roorkee University and Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG). About 30 local analogue stations were deployed for aftershock studies by these three organizations and GSI as well as NGRI. A detailed intensity survey was carried out by GSI17. Study of this earthquake with different data sets yielded better understanding of the faulting process of a major earthquake in the Himalayan frontal arc region. (reference #1266)</p>",

Almost all the buildings collapsed, clouds of dust obscured the city, and the residents poured into the streets and squares of the city to avoid being buried in the ruins of their homes. Nothing remained of the city except heaps of ruins. Fortunately, it was not very late and almost no one had gone to bed. For this reason, only one person died, but many were slightly injured. Recurrent shocks at short intervals lasted all night. At Acapulco, the sea retreated about 6 m from shore, and the residents were very much afraid that it would return with greater force and flood them all; however, the regular sea level was gradually restored.

A seiche was observed in Khlong Saensaep in Bangkok, Thailand and sink holes which may\r\nhave been caused by the earthquake appeared at 3 locations in Ipoh, Malaysia. A tsunami was generated which caused some building damage (included above) in the Serangai area, north of Bengkulu. \r\n</p><p><b>Tectonic Summary</b>\r\n</p><p>The southern Sumatra earthquake of September 12, 2007 occurred as the result of thrust faulting on the boundary between the Australian plate and the Sunda plate. At the location of the earthquake, the Australia plate moves northeast with respect to the Sunda plate at a velocity of about 69 mm/year. The direction of relative plate motion is oblique to the orientation of the plate boundary offshore of the west coast of Sumatra. The component of plate-motion perpendicular to the boundary is accommodated by thrust faulting on the offshore plate-boundary. Much of the component of plate motion parallel to the plate boundary is accommodated by strike-skip faulting on the Sumatra fault, which is inland on Sumatra proper.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake of September 12, 2007 is the fourth earthquake of magnitude greater than 7.8 to have occurred in the past decade on or near the plate boundaries offshore of western Sumatra. The September 12, 2007 earthquake occurred just north of the source region of the magnitude 7.8 earthquake on June 4, 2000, which killed approximately 100 people. The great magnitude 9.1 earthquake of December 26, 2004, which produced the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami of that date, ruptured much of the boundary separating the India plate and the Burma plate. Immediately to the south of the great 2004 earthquake, the magnitude 8.6 Nias Island earthquake of March 28, 2005, ruptured a segment of the plate boundary separating the Australia and Sunda plates. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)</p>",

In the region of Martinique, the South America plate moves to the west-northwest with respect to the Caribbean plate with a velocity of about 2 cm/yr. This relative motion is accommodated largely by the South America plate thrusting beneath the Caribbean plate. The earthquake occurred within the subducted South America plate, in response to stresses generated by plate&#39;s slow distortion, rather on the thrust fault that constitutes the interface the between the Caribbean and South America plates. The subducted South American plate is seismically active to depths of almost 200 km beneath the Lesser Antilles island arc near Martinique.\r\n<p>Earthquakes, such as this one, that have focal-depths between 70 and 300 km are commonly termed &#34;intermediate-depth&#34; earthquakes. Intermediate-depth earthquakes typically cause less damage on the ground surface above their foci than is the case with similar magnitude shallow-focus earthquakes, but large intermediate-depth earthquakes may be damaging nonetheless and may be felt at great distance from their epicenters.</p></li></ul>",

The thrust nature of faulting is inferred from the characteristics of seismic waves radiated by the earthquake source. The faulting that caused the earthquake is a consequence of north-northwest, south-southeast, oriented compressive stress that ultimately arises from the motion of the India plate northwards with respect to the Eurasia plate at a rate of over 40 mm/yr. At the longitude of the earthquake epicenter, the principal boundary between these plates is situated in northern India and Pakistan, approximately 600 km south of the epicenter, but the zone of tectonic deformation associated with their convergence extends to the north of the principal boundary for more than 1000 km.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe tectonics of the epicentral region are complex, and both strike-slip and reverse faulting earthquakes have occurred in the vicinity of the October 5 shock. A magnitude 7.1 earthquake occurred on August 11, 1974, within several tens of kilometers of the 2008 shock; its aftershock sequence included earthquakes generated by both strike-slip and reverse faulting. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)</p>",

The February 21st earthquake involved oblique-thrust faulting at the easternmost limit of previous aftershocks, and like the mainshock itself is broadly associated with regional plate boundary deformation as the Pacific and Australia plates interact in the central South Island, New Zealand. This latest shock is significantly closer to the main population center of Christchurch, NZ, than is the September 2010 mainshock, in the vicinity of several other moderate (M 4 to 5) sized aftershocks located east of the main rupture zone of the 2010 event. There is no specific structure directly linking this event to the main fault of the 2010 mainshock, although there have been numerous aftershocks along generally east-west linear trends extending east from the end of the previous rupture. The north or north-east trends to the possible fault planes and the oblique thrust faulting mechanism as seen in the focal mechanism solution may reflect an association with similarly-trending faults previously mapped in the Port Hills region, just to the south of Christchurch. Since the September 3, 2010 mainshock, there have been approximately 6 M&gt;&#61;5.0 aftershocks in the Christchurch region. The February 21st earthquake represents the largest aftershock to date, more that half a magnitude unit larger than the previous largest aftershock.

(reference #9290)</p><p>At today&#39;s press conference Superintendent Dave Cliff said police expected the death toll to climb from the current number of 166 confirmed dead to 182. Previously they estimated the toll would be 180. He warned that it would be a slow process identifying the last victims as all the had to go on was the &#34;fragments of human remains&#34;, he said. To date we have confirmed the identity of 140 of the victims and expect that number to rise in the coming days, however the point we&#39;re reaching now is that the identity of those last number of bodies is becoming increasingly difficult.

The Central Weather Bureau said the 6.1-magnitude quake struck at 10:03 a.m. local time and was centered in Nantou County, at a depth of 15.4 kilometers. Aftershocks as strong as 4.3 in magnitude rattled the area for the next 2 1/2 hours. The initial temblor shook buildings in the capital, Taipei, 120 kilometers to the north. A wall that collapsed killed a 72-year-old woman at a temple in Nantou County, the National Fire Agency said, adding that 19 other people across central Taiwan were injured, mostly by falling objects.

Felt (VII) at Ascoli Piceno and (VI) at Civitanova Marche, L&#39;Aquila, Nocciano, Recanati and Terni. Felt throughout central and northern Italy, in San Marino and (IV) in Vatican City. Felt in parts of  Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Germany, Slovenia and Switzerland. Preliminary studies by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia indicate that at least 15km of fault scarps were observed in the Monte Vettore area between Arquata del Tronto and Ussita, with about 50cm of offset observed in the Monte Bove Sud area.\r\n<p>The October 30, 2016 M 6.6 earthquake north of Norcia, Italy, occurred as the result of shallow normal faulting on a NW-SE oriented fault in the Central Apennines. The Apennines is a mountain range that runs from the Gulf of Taranto in the south to the southern edge of the Po basin in northern Italy. Geologically, the Apennines is largely an accretionary wedge formed as a consequence of subduction.  The October 30, 2016 normal faulting earthquake is an intraplate event, an expression of the east-west extensional tectonics that now dominate along the Apennine belt. The October 30, 2016 event is the largest event in an on-going sequence of damaging earthquakes that include:\r\n</p><p>- the August 24, 2016, M 6.2 central Italy (Amatrice) earthquake which caused approximately 300 fatalities, and severely damaged the town of Amatrice.\r\n</p><p>- The October 26, 2016, M 6.1 central Italy earthquake, which, at the time of writing, is not known to have caused any fatalities. This M 6.1 event was preceded by several hours by a M 5.5 earthquake.\r\n</p><p>The October 30, M 6.6 event is between the two prior largest earthquakes, approximately 10 km southeast of the October 26, M 6.1 event. While related to the previous seismicity, the larger size of this earthquake implies it has ruptured an independent fault patch that had not slipped as part of preceding earthquakes. \r\n</p><p>(above from ref #1053)\r\n</p><p>There were no reported fatalities in the wake of the quake on Sunday, although it was even more powerful than the 2009 earthquake that hit L&#39;Aquila, killing more than 300 people, and worse than the August earthquake that killed hundreds in Amatrice. There were about a dozen injuries, with one person described as being in serious condition.\r\n</p><p>Residents in Visso, a town of 1,107 in Marche, told Sky TV that their homes &#34;are no longer there&#34;.\r\n</p><p>While there was relative relief that the area was spared mass casualties, there were other losses that were devastating. Centuries-old structures, including the cathedral and basilica of San Benedetto in Norcia, a 14th century church that was built to honor the patron saint of Europe, Saint Benedict, was reduced to rubble, as was a tower and St Augustine church in Amatrice.\r\n</p><p>(above from ref #11619)\r\n</p><p>The 30 October main shock crushed definitely all the villages of the epicentral area, extending northward the level of destruction and inducing heavy damage even to the 30 km far Camerino town.

(ref #1350)\r\n<p>A powerful overnight earthquake shook holiday resorts in Greece and Turkey, injuring nearly 500 people and leaving two tourists dead on the Greek island of Kos, where revelers at a bar were crushed in a building collapse. Some of the injuries were caused as tourists and local residents scrambled out of buildings and even leapt from balconies after the 6.5-magnitude quake struck at about 1:30 am local time. Several hundred thousand vacationers and locals in the two countries were kept awake by dozens of aftershocks that followed the main quake, with many sleeping outdoors on sunbeds or slumped on cafe tables. Authorities on Kos said the two dead tourists were from Sweden and Turkey. Thirteen others injured were airlifter to other Greek hospitals, include a foreign national who had to have a leg amputated and another with life-threatening head injuries. In neighboring Turkey, authorities said some 350 people were hurt, most with light injuries as they fled buildings. Seismologists said the shallow depth of the quake was to blame for the damage and a 60 cm sea swell that scattered cars, boats, and trash bins across shorelines in the east Aegean Sea. (ref #11848)\r\n</p><p>The earthquake happened in Gokova Bay on July 21, 2017 at 01:31 local time (22:31 UTC) at 36.9620N 27.4053E (KOERI), with the moment magnitude of Mw&#61;6.6 (Ml&#61; 6.2) at a depth of 5km. The epicenter is about 12km ENE of Kos, Greece and 8 km SSW of Bodrum, Turkey. The earthquake was highly felt in Southwestern Aegean Region, especially in Mugla Province. The fault mechanism calculations reveal that the earthquake occurred with a normal faulting (ref #11858)\r\n</p><p>The epicentral region is an active seismic zone due to the presence of three main tectonic plate borders: African, Arabian, and Anatolian plates. To the south of the epicenter, the Hellenic subduction zone is subducting beneath the Anatolian microplate; to the east, the Anatolian microplate is in strike-slip motions along its northeast and southeast boundaries with the Eurasian and Arabian plates, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, the 2017 Mw 6.6 event occurred as an intraplate earthquake in the Aegean Sea region within the Anatolian microplate which is part of the Eurasian Plate. According to Kurt et al. (1999), the epicentral area is under a N-S extensional tectonic regime (35-40 mm/year according to Ebeling et al. 2012) which is most probably attributed to the westerly escape of the Anatolian plate in response to the collision of the African, Eurasian, and Arab plates.

Focusing on the island of Kos, secondary effects were reported in the eastern part, including liquefaction- related phenomena and tsunami[...]Liquefaction-induced lateral spreading caused severe structural damages at the waterfront area of the city of Kos[...]The majority of the documented liquefaction related failures was located at the waterfront area of the city of Kos. In particular, the new port and the custom buildings were strongly affected, resulting to the loss of their functionality. At the main pier, a subsidence of up to 35 cm and tilting of the lighthouse were documented. Cracks parallels to the seashore were reported in the old harbor of the city behind the quay wall with horizontal displacement up to 10 cm and up to 35 cm vertical offset. Liquefaction manifestations were reported in cape Louros, an area covered by Holocene age coastal deposits. (ref #12410)</p>",

        "comments": "<b>Tectonic Summary</b><p>The March 1, 2019, M 7.0 Peru earthquake near Lake Titicaca, occurred as the result of normal faulting at an intermediate depth, approximately 260 km beneath southeastern Peru within the lithosphere of the subducted Nazca plate. Focal mechanism solutions indicate that rupture occurred on either a steeply dipping normal fault striking westward, or on a shallowly dipping normal fault striking to the southeast. Slip on a fault of either orientation would accommodate the down-dip extension of the Nazca slab. At the location of the earthquake, the oceanic Nazca plate moves east-northeast relative to the South America plate at a rate of about 71 mm/yr, subducting at the Peru-Chile Trench west of the Peruvian coast and sinking into the mantle beneath South America. Like most western South America earthquakes, this event was caused by strains generated by the ongoing subduction process.\r\n</p><p>Earthquakes like this event, with focal depths between 70 and 300 km, are commonly termed intermediate-depth earthquakes. Intermediate-depth earthquakes represent deformation within subducted slabs rather than at the shallow plate interface between subducting and overriding tectonic plates. They typically cause less damage on the ground surface above their foci than is the case with similar-magnitude shallow-focus earthquakes, but large intermediate-depth earthquakes may be felt at great distance from their epicenters. Deep-focus earthquakes, those with focal depths greater than 300 km, also occur in the subducted Nazca plate farther east from the Peru-Chile Trench, beneath western Brazil and central Argentina. Earthquakes have been reliably located to depths of about 650 km in this region.\r\n</p><p>The Peru-Chile Trench is an area that hosts large earthquakes quite regularly. Within 500 km of the February 22nd earthquake, there have been 10 other intermediate depth earthquakes with magnitudes of 6.5&#43; over the preceding century. Today&#39;s earthquake is the largest of these; another M 7.0 event occurred about 280 km to the northwest in July 1991, at a depth of about 100 km. That event caused some damage in Cuzco.\r\n</p><p>(all above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>In the Goyeneche Hospital: one person was admitted to the emergency service for cardiac arrest, his current situation is deceased. At Hospital Honorio Delgado one person from Socabaya district entered the emergency service due to fall and is currently under observation. (reference #12387)</p>",

The earthquake occurred on either a southeast striking right-lateral fault, or on a southwest striking left-lateral fault. The regional geologic context is consistent with right-lateral strike slip motion. The earthquake occurred within a broad zone of strike-slip faults that demark, in part, the boundary between the Eurasia and India plates. These seismically active strike-slip faults and smaller faults in their vicinity produce frequent, yet often moderate (smaller than M7.0) earthquakes. In the past century, 24 earthquakes of M6.0 or greater have occurred within 250 km of the May 21 earthquake, with one of those earthquakes (May 29, 1976) being M7.0. The most recent moderate magnitude earthquake in this region occurred on August 30, 2008 (M6.0). The August 2008 M6.0 earthquake led to extensive regional damage and at least 43 fatalities. Other earthquakes in this region with similar magnitudes have led to tens to hundreds of fatalities. The steep regional topography can also lead to earthquake shaking-induced landslides and liquefaction (ground failure).\u00a0<br />Generally, strike-slip faults and earthquakes in south-central China result from the southeastward motion of the Earth&#39;s crust that is driven by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian continental plates beneath the Himalaya Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau farther to the west. The Tibetan Plateau exhibits east-west oriented extension, as evidenced by faults, earthquake normal faulting mechanisms, and geodetic observations. The extension of the Tibetan Plateau is further accommodated by extrusion of crustal material southward in south-central China along the strike-slip faults where the May 21 earthquake occurred.</p><p>(all above from ref #1053)</p><p>The quakes, including a 6.4-magnitude one, has claimed three lives and injured 28 others by early Saturday.

The earthquake occurred at shallow depths on either a reverse fault striking west and dipping to the north with a component of left-lateral slip, or a fault striking southeast and dipping to the southwest with a component of right-lateral slip. At the location of the earthquake, the local plate boundary is dominated by left-lateral strike slip motion and compression. The plate boundary in this location accommodates eastward, left-lateral motion of the Caribbean plate relative to the North America plate. Within this context, the earthquake likely occurred on the east-west striking, north dipping fault plane with a component of left-lateral slip [...]<br />The location and focal mechanism solutions of the August 2021 earthquake are consistent with the event resulting from primarily reverse faulting with a component of left-lateral strike slip faulting on the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone (EPGFZ). Overall, the EPGFZ accommodates about 7 mm/yr of motion, nearly half the total oblique convergence between the Caribbean and North America plates (~20 mm/yr). Haiti occupies the western part of the island of Hispaniola, one of the Greater Antilles Islands, situated between Puerto Rico and Cuba. At the location of the August 2021 earthquake, motion between the Caribbean and North America plates is partitioned between two major east-west-trending, strike slip fault systems\u2014the Septentrional fault system in northern Haiti and the EPGFZ in southern Haiti.\u00a0<br />The EPGFZ had produced a series of major earthquakes in both instrumental and historical time periods. In addition to the 2010 M 7 earthquake that devastated Port-au-Prince, the EPGFZ is the likely source of historical large earthquakes in 1860, 1770, and 1751, though none of these has been confirmed in the field as associated with this fault.\u00a0</p><p><i>Ref #13010, 13011, 13013, 13015, </i>13016,13018:<br />2207 deceased persons; 12268 persons injured; 344 missing persons as at August 18, 2021. 52,953 houses destroyed and 77,006 houses damaged in the 3 most affected departments (South, Grand\u2019Anse and Nippes).

It goes on to say that, at Echinus and at Scarphea in Boeotia in the Gulf between Thessaly and Boetia, there was a sudden inlux of the sea, which leveled both towns. The sea flooded the mainland for a long time, so that for a very considerable period it was possible for men to walk to the islands, which are inside this gulf, since the sea had abandoned its proper place and spread over the land as far as the mountains. When the sea returned to its proper place, fish were left on the ground.\r\n</p><p>It is important to recognize that Procopius places earthquakes in the plural, in the context of more than one earthquake in more than one place... he clearly refers to more than  one, probably three, distinct earthquakes in central Greece, that is (1) a destructive shock in Boeotia that caused great loss of life in Schisma and destroyed Coronea and Chaeronea, probably damaging Corinth; (2) a destructive sea wave at Echinus and Scarpheia, which was probably associated with a second earthquake about 70 km away in the Maliakos Gulf between Thessaly and Boettia; and (3) a damaging shock more than 100 km to the west of Schisma in the Gulf of Corinth and in Achaea, which heavily damaged Nafpaktos and Patra. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #9116)</p>",

On Tuesday, 18 Sha&#39;ban 242, there was a catastrophic earthquake in the eastern Alburz which devastated the district of Qumis and the region of western Khurasan dependent on Nishapur. Along a fertile tract of land running for 350 km between the Alburz and the Dasht-i Kavir, from Khuvar to beyond Bustam and in parts of Tabaristan and Gurgan, 200,000 people were killed and practically all villages were ruined. In the district of Qumis, the earthquake was worst at Damaghan, which was half destroyed with 45096 casualties. In the mountain regions there were extensive ground deformations, including probably surface faulting. The old city of Shahr-i Qumis, former capital of the province, was also destroyed and was probably finally abandoned after the earthquake. One third of Bustam collapsed and the region between this town\r\nand Damghan still showed the effects of the earthquake\r\ntwo generations later. Tabaristan and Gurgan were also\r\naffected by the shock, which had a disastrous effect\r\non the water supplies of the district of Qumis, either\r\ncausing the drying up of springs and qanats, or triggering\r\nlandslides which dammed the streams flowing down to\r\nthe plain. Outside the meizoseismal region, Nishapur to the east and the Jibal province to the west and southwest of Qumis were also strongly shaken, the earthquake being felt in Ray, Qum, and as far as Isfahan, where it caused great concern. Aftershocks continued for some years, probably causing damage in western Khurasan. (reference #1117)\r\n<p>856, December 22. 36.15 N, 54.36 E, Damghan, intensity X-XI.

The Qumis earthquake was a major event and it occurred on Tuesday, 18 Sha&#39;aban 242 (22 December 856) in the districts of Qumis and Nishapur, 450 km from Isfahan. It caused the deaths of about 200,000 people. In Damghan alone (which was the worst affected region) 45,096\r\npeople perished. It is not unlikely, therefore, that the shock which was felt over a vast area was also felt in Isfahan. (reference #1130)\r\n</p><p>856, December 3-30 (AH 242 Sha&#39; ban). Violent earthquakes. In Tunis about 45,000 persons were buried under the ruins. The shaking extended to Yemen, Khurasan region, Syria, Fars region, Bastam, Qom, Kashan, Shahr-Rey, Damghan, Ghirgan, Neyshabur, Taberistan, Esfahan and other places in Iran.

(reference #1222)\r\n</p><p>From the preceding notes which cover the years 853 A.D. to 856 A.D. we may conclude that this was a period of severely damaging earthquake activity, mostly confined to well defined areas in which we may reasonably ascribe epicentral areas as at Ray and farther east another at Kumash (or Qumes) including Damaghan. To the south we identify a third epicentral region in Kashan and farther south a center in Fars province and this latter is difficult to localize within the large area of the province. Hamadan also having been much affected in this period may be considered as an epicenter or more likely was involved as an extension from events centered at Ray or Kashan. (reference #1217)</p>",

Many houses overthrown, many victims. Landslides, crevasses and tidal waves. Felt in Mantua and Verona. (reference #1093)\r\n</p><p>1633, November 5. An earthquake in Zante caused the collapse of houses. The town of Zante was damaged by three consecutive shocks as a result of which a portion of high land jutting out into the Gulf of Lagana collapsed, turning the tip of the promontory of Agios Sostis into an islet and causing the sea to swell, though no damage resulted. In other places on the island mountains were shattered and the ground opened up. This event is recorded by Girardi, who dates it to 5 November 1633 (Julian calendar). It is clear for reasons of distance that this cannot have been the same earthquake as was felt in northern Italy). A similar account(without mention of northern Italy) is given by the seventeenth-century writer Riccioli. (reference #9116)</p>",

(The Credo or profession of faith was recited in Latin for divine protection, especially in articulo mortis, i.e., in the expectation of death)[...]Reports from beyond Santiago are scant and unreliable because of the low population density.

About 20 per cent of the population was killed in the earthquake[...]the great Santiago earthquak eof 1647 should probably be assigned to the coastal or offshore subduction zone, asin the Central Chilean earthquakes of 1730, 1822, 1906, 1965, and 1971.

Preceded by a strong foreshock, a catastrophic earthquake on the night of Friday to Saturday 29 Dhu &#39;l-Hijja 1193 to I Muharram 1194 (7-8 January 1780) in the region of Tabriz almost totally destroyed the city and devastated about 400 villages, including Marand, Tasuj and Iranaq. In Tabriz itself, all major buildings, weakened by previous shocks, were ruined and all private houses, as well as the fort and walls of the city were totally destroyed, the radius of destruction being variously given as 72 or 120 km from Tabriz. Outside this distance, in Khuy, Salmas, Urmiyeh and Gunayi (?), buildings were damaged but there was no loss of life. Vast numbers of people perished in this earthquake, estimates ranging to over 200,000. The number was probably somewhere around <b>50,000</b>. Among these were the son of the ruler of Tabriz, Fazl&#39;ali Beg Dunbuli, along with some 700 retainers who were killed when the palace collapsed. The earthquake was responsible for the destruction of all the historical buildings in Tabriz. Among those which were restored afterwards and still exist today (in greatly altered form) we may note the Friday mosque in the bazaar, work on which was begun by Ahmad Khan Dunbuli immediately after the earthquake. The Sahib alAmr mosque was restored in 1208/1794 by Ja&#39;far Khan Dunbuli in a complex immediately north of the Mihran-rud, that includes the Thiqat al-Islam mosque. Both these complexes include other buildings named as having been severely affected by the earthquake, for example the Talibiyyeh madraseh adjoining the Friday mosque, which was originally a Safavid foundation (built in 1087/1676), and the Hasan Padshah mosque and madraseh adjoining the Sahib al-Amr (originally built by Uzun Hasan (d. 882/1478). The Sadiqiyyeh madraseh, also a Safavid foundation, still survives in the bazaar area, and the shrine and madraseh of Sayyid Hamza (d. 714/1314) are in the Surkhab quarter to the north. The mosque of &#39;Alishah is now reduced to the ruins known as the Arg, and the Ustadc-Shagird mosque and the Dal-o-Zal mosque have also survived to the present day.

Late in the afternoon of 20 June (Old Style)/2 July 1840, a catastrophic earthquake hit the isolated region between the upper Euphrates and Mount Ararat, affecting a large area in Russia, Turkey and Iran. The main concentration of damage was in the districts of Avajik, Pambukh and Gailatu, where almost all villages were destroyed with great loss of life. In Dogubayazit all houses, including the castle, were ruined with the exception of the mosque. Kazl-gol and Masun were also destroyed. In the region of the upper Euphrates many settlements were severely damaged, and in Bazargan and Maku few houses survived intact.\r\n<p>Further away in Kagizman, Kulp and Igdir, as well as in the plain of the Araxes, from the district of Sharur to Nakhichevan and Urdubad, the shock was less severe but it did cause widespread damage to those villages situated in the low-lying parts of the plain. Here, the ground is marshy and as a result of the earthquake numerous areas to the west of the Araxes between the Qareh-su and the Arpa-chai rivers were intensely fractured. Liquefied sand was ejected from fissures in the ground and on all spots where the banks of the Araxes and Qareh-su are high. Landslides and slumping of the ground added to the damage. Landslides triggered by aftershocks overwhelmed the village of Qareh Khajilu and elsewhere the flow of the Araxes was temporarily dammed, the river over-topping its banks and flooding the surroundings. In the low-lying parts of the Sharur and Nakhichevan districts in Russian territory, the earthquake and its aftershocks ruined 7821 houses, 24 churches and mosques, 107 water mills and <b>killed 49 people</b>, injuring about 30.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake triggered a colossal slide from above the snow-line of the northeastern side of Mount Ararat. A mass of shattered rock, ice and snow moved down the mountain so fast that a violent air blast was sent out in front of it. Before it was arrested by a natural darn about 900 m above the valley floor, the slide overwhelmed Arguri, the only village in Ararat, <b>killing all its inhabitants (about 1000 in all)</b> and destroying the small monastery of St James (St Jacob), 3 km above, burying all the monks and destroying also the holy well of St James. At nine in the morning of 24 June (Old Style)/6 July, the natural dam burst and within minutes the slide debris spread out into the plain below in a 12 km-wide front, destroying, Aralik and three other villages 20 km away. It blocked the Qareh-su river which was forced to change its course.\r\n</p><p>Rockfalls and slides were reported from other parts of the meizoseismal region, notably from Pambukh and Chingal, where they killed people and herds of sheep. As a result of the earthquake, the flow in many of the streams and springs in the upper Euphrates and in the Sharur district increased, while in the region of Nakhichevan many springs dried up for some time. \r\n</p><p>The earthquake caused minor damage at Edjmiadsin, Erivan and Gar&#39;ni and it was strongly felt in Alexandropol (Leninakan), Tiflis, in the Karabagh, at Shusha, in Tabriz and in Van. The shock was also felt at Linkuran, in the Talish district on the coast of the Caspian, as well as on the eastern shores of the Black Sea. Aftershocks continued for some time, causing additional damage, particularly in the plain of the Araxes and around Maku and Kazl-gcl. They did not stop until early in 1841.\r\n</p><p>(above from referrence #1117)\r\n</p><p>1840 June 20 - July 28 (old style) 6h45m P.N. at Tiflis, at 7h10m (P.R.?) at Erivan at 7h30m.

It rapidly intensified for 10 sec, after which what seemed like an explosion was heard and the ground shook violently for a minute. Two of these shocks were especially strong. All the public buildings, homes, blast furnaces and stone quarries were almost completely destroyed. 600 families were left homeless with no means of subsistence. Since it was a holiday, all the people were in the streets, as a result of which there were only <b>two casualties</b>. Ground waves were observed. The regime of subterranean waters and springs changed (VIII degrees, on the M. scale). Aftershocks continued at least until the first days of Oct. </p><p>Several walls collapsed at Ovalle; a number of buildings were severely damaged (VIII). Extensive physical damage was done at Salamanca (VIII). At Petorca there were strong tremors lasting 1 min, preceded by a loud rumble. Public buildings were heavily damaged. The majority of homes were rendered unfit for habitation, and some of them collapsed completely.</p><p>There was slight damage at San Felipe. A cathedral was destroyed at Quillota. One church tower collapsed, and another sank to one side at Vina del Mar. The roof of one home collapsed at Limache. At Valparaiso, cornices collapsed and walls cracked here and there. At Santiago, there were strong prolonged tremors, causing slight damage: cornices collapsed here and there, walls cracked, statues tumbled. The bells rang at Rancagua. There were strong tremors at Talca. Several dilapidated walls crumbled at Concepcion, and underground rumbling was heard from the north.</p><p>The earthquake was stronger at La Serena than at Los Vilos; one or two ranch houses sank to one side. There were strong, prolonged tremors at Copiapo. The earthquake was noted at Mendosa, La Rioja and San Juan.</p><p>There were strong tremors at Coquimbo. Large columns of water arose at sea, as a result of which the anchor chain snapped in one ship. The underwater cable across the mouth of the Limari River was broken at a depth of 1.8 km.</p><p>(above from ref #415)\r\n</p><p>1880, August 15, at 8:48 a.m. lllapel earthquake. <b>Two persons were killed</b> and many buildings destroyed in Illapel; Petorca was also seriously damaged...  All railroad stations of the Santiago-Valparaiso line reported damage. The submarine cable was broken at a depth of 1800 meters off the estuary of the Limari River. Several landslides occurred in the Illapel-Petorca area. The epicenter of this earthquake could have been offshore; the epicentral area (VII) is more than one degree long. There are no reports from the sparsely settled coast except for Los Vilos, a locality on firm ground which shows consistently low intensities. The argument of Montessus de Ballore for an inland epicenter is not conclusive. The cable break near the mouth of the Limari River could indicate in epicenter in this vicinity.

Though it occurred in an unstable region, in one of the most unstable provinces of India, no earlier Assam earthquake has possessed a disturbed area of more than a few hundred thousand sq. miles.</p><p>The earthquake occurred at about 5.15 pm., local time, and, as most persons were then out of doors, the death-roll for so great an earthquake was comparatively small. The total number of persons <strong>killed was only 1,542</strong>, about <strong>600 of these by landslips</strong> at and near Cherrapunji, 117 at Cheyla, and 17 in the coal-mines of Cherrapunji.</p><p>The damage to property must have been very great, for, within an area of 30,000 sq. miles, all brick and stone buildings were practically destroyed, and in this area were to be found all the principal towns of the province-shillong, Sylhet, Gauhati, Goalpara, Dhubri and Turaf.</p><p>A great part of the area in which the earthquake was felt is a wild thinly populated country. Brick and stone buildings are rare and widely scattered. Thus, a detailed scale, such as the Rossi-Fore1 scale, was useless, and the following simple scale was devised by Mr. Oldham for the purpose:</p><ul><li>The destruction of brick and stone buildings was practically universal.</li><li>The damage to masonry or brick buildings was universal, often serious, amounting in some cases to destruction.</li><li>All or nearly all brick buildings were damaged.</li><li>The earthquake was universally felt, severely enough to disturb furniture and loose objects, but not to cause damage, except in a few instances, to brick buildings. The shock was strong enough to be generally noticed, but not to cause any damage. The earthquake was only noticed by a small proportion of people who were sitting or lying down or were otherwise favorably placed for observing it.</li></ul><p>Roughly, these degrees may be taken to correspond with the following degrees of the Rossi-Forel scale: 1O, 9, 8, 7-6, 5-4 and 3-2.</p><p>The number of after-shocks was very great, and they originated in many different centres scattered over a very wide area.</p><p>(above from reference #516)</p><p>Reference #1003 lists earthquake on June 12, 1897, 11:06 UTC, 26 N, 91 E, magnitude 8.7.</p><p>Reference #1002 lists earthquake on June 12, 1897, in Khasi Hills, Assam, magnitude 8.7, <strong>1,500 killed</strong>.</p><p>Reference #1055 lists earthquake on June 12, 1897, 11:05 UTC, in Assam, intensity III which corresponds to an earthquake which destroyed towns and devastated districts.</p><p>Reference #1095 lists earthquake on June 12, 1897 in Assam. Probably the greatest earthquake that has occurred anywhere during historic times. Felt over an area of 1,750,000 sq. miles, with the epicenter in the Shillong plateau. Destruction of stone buildings almost universal in Shillong, Goalpara, Gauhati, Nowgong and Sylhet. Calcutta seriously effected. About <strong>1600 lives lost</strong>.

The total number of people killed as a result of the earthquake amounts to 1542 with the following distribution by district: 916 in the Khasi and Jainta Hills, 545 in Sylhet, 29 Kampur, 27 in the Garo Hills, 12 in Darrang, 5 in Goalpara, 3 in Nowgong, 3 in Si1char, and 2 in Sibsagar. We found no reports of loss of life among members of the various Christian missionary stations in Assam and in the Sylhet Plains.

There was an earthquake near the Huon Peninsula. It was registered over the globe. It began with light oscillations, which rapidly intensified and lasted a minute. The main earthquake was followed by weaker shocks, occurring at intervals of a few minutes. It was especially strong in the coastal mountains from Cape Hardenberghuk in the north to the Lugaueng Mountains in the south and for 20 km inland, and also on the W coast of New Britain. Here, frequent yawning cracks opened up everywhere in the ground; numerous and extensive slumps, landslides and rock falls occurred, which changed the appearance of the locale from [Cape?] Festunghuk to [Mount?] Sattelberg, and especially in the valley of the Bussim River. <b>Several (from 10 -20 to 100) local inhabitants were buried</b>. Their custom of settling on the steep slopes as being the safest places in the frequent sudden attacks by their enemies, contributed to the fatalities.</p><p>All channels were buried under piles of earth for weeks. Torrential rains washed them out, and an enormous amount of forest was carried out to sea. The force of tremors was 9 degrees at Wareo, all the structures here suffered serious destruction, and a just completed home was ripped from its piles and shifted 90 cm; all the stoves were destroyed, and reservoirs filled with water were torn from their foundations and flattened. The tremors had a force of 10 degrees at Sattelberg and Lugaueng. At Sattelberg, a very old home with weak foundations was torn from its piles and displaced 2 m, and the church sank so much to one side that it had to be pulled down. At Lugaueng, trees were broken. The oscillations were only a little weaker in the region of Finschhafen bay. On Madang Island, two old dilapidated homes were ripped from rotten piles and displaced 1-2 m. At Pola, objects fell to the ground in the homes, palm trees were bent to the ground, and people were unable to move. Similar effects - collapse of stoves, the tilting of homes, the falling of cupboards and shelves - were reported from all coastal points.</p><p>The pleistoseismic zone of the earthquake extended from Cape King William to Cape Cretin; on land, its boundary passed between Sattelberg and Nanson Mountain. Changes in relief occurred on the W coast of New Britain; a landslide was seen on the slopes of Mount Hunstein which destroyed the underlying village.</p><p>At Bulesoma, Deinzerhoe and on Cape Arcona, the force of tremors was 5 degrees. A landslide was reported at the mouth of the Markham River between Cape Arcona and Huon Gulf (the Preusen Reede). On Tami Island, the tremors had a force of about 4 degrees, while they were weaker on the Siassi Islands and Umboi Island. At the same time, the earthquake was strong in Astrolabe Bay and was noticed at Potsdamhafen.</p><p>Tidal waves were observed along the entire coast from Heldsbuch on the north to Busega in Huon Gulf, and also on the islands of Tami, Siassi and  Umboi.</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #79:</i></blockquote><p>1906, Sept 14, 16:04 UTC. 7 S 149 E, Dampier Strait, magnitude 8.1 MS.

We propose that the 1908 tsunami was generated by a composite source: coseismic seafloor displacement and landslides of a few cubic km (1-5 km3) suddenly triggered by the earthquake.</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><br /><b><h2>Different Reports of Epicenters, Magnitudes and Effects</h2></b>\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td>\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Latitude</b></td><td><b>Longitude</b></td><td><b>Magnitude</b></td><td><b>Depth</b></td><td><b>Intensity</b>\r\n</td><td><b>$Million<br />Damage</b></td><td><b>Deaths<br />(Earthquake)</b></td><td><b>Deaths<br />(Tsunami)</b></td><td><b>Reference #</b></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>46,869-82,035</td><td></td><td>516</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>58,000</td><td></td><td>1059</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>83,000</td><td></td><td>1182</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>85,925</td><td></td><td>1248</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>116</td><td>75,000</td><td></td><td>1250</td></tr><tr><td>38.07 N</td><td>15.53 E</td><td></td><td>40 km</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1392</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>80,000</td><td></td><td>2130</td></tr><tr><td>38 N</td><td>15.5 E</td><td>7 Ms</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2231</td></tr><tr><td>38.183 N</td><td>15.683 E</td><td>7.2</td><td></td><td>XI</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4139</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>60,000-100,000</td><td>2,000</td><td>5096</td></tr><tr><td>38 N</td><td>15.5 E</td><td>7.2 Ms, 7.1 Mw</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>60,000-100,000</td><td></td><td>9910</td></tr><tr><td>38 N</td><td>15.349 E</td><td>7.03 Mw</td><td>15 km</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>10476</td></tr><tr><td>38.17 N</td><td>15.58 E</td><td>7</td><td></td><td>11.5</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>11000</td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n",

Fires broke out as the result of collapses. The telegraph link was cut. Balaiselasa, Muaralabuh, Kambang, where the ground cracked, and Painan felt very strong tremors. At Padang, the walls of many stone buildings cracked and slanted; pillars broke in two but did not collapse; there were no victims. At Solok panic reigned and everyone ran from the cracking homes; ornaments fell from the walls to the floor. The road bewteen Kubangnandua and Alahanpadjang cracked. The lighthouse at Pulu Pandiang buzzed, the tower clock rang out, and oil spilled out of the reservoir. At Banko, this was the strongest earthquake in living memory. At Ipu, the tremors lasted a minute. Strong shocks were registered at Padangpandjang; at Bua, where the wooden barracks creaked people were rocked and a lamp on a cord 1.5 m long oscillated with the same amplitude; and at Taluk where homes and trees swayed, and boats in the river felt a strong shaking. Rather strong shocks, accompanied by a roar, were felt at Djambi and Bajunglentjir, where shutters rattled strongly, lamps swayed and furniture vibrated, and at Rengat and Talu. The earthquake was felt at Pajakumbuh, Pakanbaru, Djebus, Tandjungpinang and Palembang. At Singapore, some sleepers were awakened by strong unpleasant vibrations and the creaking of furniture, doors and windows; here and there, residents rushed to the sreets in panic and some heard a rumble. A number of considerable aftershocks were felt. A tidal wave, which may have done damage, occurred near the focal zone (at Tandjung, Pau, Muti and other places). Large movements of the water were observed at Kambang.  \r\n</p><p>Gutenberg, Richter (1954): 3.VI; 18<sup>h</sup>40.8<sup>m</sup>; 2<sup>o</sup>S., 101<sup>o</sup> E.; M&#61;6.7.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #88:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>June 3, 1909 at 18:44 UTC, 2S, 102E, shallow depth, magnitude 7.7.</p>",

The small villages of Abdirjan, Maki and Deh Lakarkuh in the sparsely populated area east of Ravar were totally destroyed with many casualties. Almost all the houses in Ravar and its adjoining settlements were ruined. In the town itself, which had a population of 6000 at the time of the earthquake, several of the carpet-weaving factories and the masjid-i ami&#39; collapsed, killing fifty people. Ravar remained in ruins for a long time, its public buildings only being rebuilt thirty years later.</p><p>The main shock and its aftershocks triggered many rockfalls from the northeast face of Lakarkuh, and it is very probable that the shock was associated with faulting west of Abdirjan, extending for a few kilometres in a south-southeasterly direction. However, when parts of this region were visited some years ago there was no discernible evidence of very recent faulting, except that the alignment pointed out to us as having been activated in 1911 happens to belong to a thrust zone bearing 160o E.</p><p>Minor damage extended to a number of villages, and the shock was strongly felt in Kirman, Deh Zu&#39;iyeh and Kuhbanan.

According to field observations and to interpreted satellite photographs, a right-hand shear fault took place over 3 m in size along the diagonal fault extending from the apex of the Gulf of\r\nSaros at an azimuth of 65&#34; through the base of the Gallipoli Peninsula towards the point of Gazikoy (Ganos - ref) on the coast of the Sea of Marmara and farther, apparently, continuing on the sea -bottom. The length of the ground part of the fault is 50 km. Certain vertical movements also took place: the south-eastern block with the mountain ridge of Tekirdag rose a little, the north-western block sank. A complex system of ruptures was formed at the\r\nearth&#39;s surface in the zone of the fault the width of which amounted to 5 km. Numerous rockfalls, screes, collapses, changes in the conditions of ground and underground water, cracking of the earth, the dilution of coastal marine and\r\nlacustrine sediments. Mud with oil was thrown out of some fissures, bitumen was extruded and so on. The earthquake lasted 40 s within the focal zone, and over 1 min far away fiom it. 2,800 inhabitants were killed, 7,000 inhabitants\r\nwere wounded, 12,600 houses were destroyed completely in more than 300 settlements, and 12,100 houses were damaged beyond repair; a further 15,400 houses were seriously damaged. 241 mosques and 72 churches were also destroyed. The cities of Istanbul, Edirne, Adapazari, Bursa, Edremit and others suffered. Minarets, mosques, orphanages, hospitals, government buildings were damaged in Istanbul; all the chimneys and part of the city walls collapsed. The\r\neffects of the earthquake in Edime were similar. The buildings with long periods of natural oscillations were the most vulnerable far away from the earthquake focus. The constructions more accurately projected and built suffered little even within the focal zone. This earthquake was the strongest in Europe (M &#61; 7.4) at the beginning of the 20th century and was accompanied by numerous aftershocks (the strongest shock was of M &#61; 6.6 a month later). \r\n<p>After the earthquake, the sea receded a certain distance from the shore along the coast of the Sea of Marmara near Tekirdug and in the straits, and then it came back with force, but did no damage.

The movement, of a few seconds duration, knocked all the buildings out of line and caused slides on the sides of the valley, claiming <b>several victims</b>. All the villages of the Mejes Valley were affected, particularly Chuquimbamba (2921 m a.s.l.) where besides throwing down the Matriz church, it damaged houses. The vibrations caused cracking of the church of the village of Calloma (4354 m a.s.l.), in the peaks of the Cordillera Occidental. In the coastal zone the villages of Ocona and Atico suffered. In the city of Arequipa several buildings were slightly damaged. On the basis of the destructive effects of the shock, Umlauf (1913) estimated an epicentral area of 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>, bounded by the Intensity X MM isoseist, while he limited the intensity VII to an elliptical area of 58,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The movement was felt as far as Iquique (Chile) and La Paz (Bolivia).

There was an earthquake with source, according to the Wiechert seismograph at Djakarta (Batavia), southeast of Bali Island. On Bali Island, there were very strong regular horizontal oscillations, here and there accompanied by vertical shocks, which lasted 50 minutes [seconds?]. The force of tremors depended very much on ground conditions, but on the whole decreased markedly from the south coast of the island to the north coast. Bamboo huts on loose grounds on the south of the island collapsed; stone houses cracked and partly collapsed. There were numerous  landslides and avalanches, which buried houses and people (about 80% of the total number of victims in the earthquake were due to avalanches). The earthquake was also very strong on Lombok Island, from Mataram to Selong, and weak on Sumbawa Island and on the east of Java Island (at Bondowoso, Djember and Kraksann). It was preceded by a foreshock, which was felt slightly at Denpasar on January 7, and was accompanied by a rather large number of aftershocks. A small tidal wave was observed on the southeastern shore of Bali Island from Klunkung to Benoa. The wave did no damage. \r\n</p><p>[20.I; 23<sup>h</sup>11<sup>m</sup>34<sup>s</sup>; 7<sup>o</sup>?

Ref #1914 and 9910 list 7.3 Mw (MMI VIII). The map in Ref #1078 lists a MMI intensity IX at Punta Borinquen, closest dry land to the epicenter. Immediately following the shock a tsunami broke upon the shore, drowning many persons and destroying many native dwellings.<p><b>Earthquake Damage</b> (from Reference #1128): </p><p>Most extensive property damage reports were received from Aguada and Anasco, both located on alluvium in western Puerto Rico. In Aguada, masonry buildings were largely demolished. Some walls, badly cracked by the main shock were thrown down by the aftershock of October 24. The church, built prior to 1867, was entirely destroyed. Some concrete walls and foundations without reinforcement were wrecked. A one-story reinforced concrete school was practically undamaged, and frame buildings were not damaged appreciably. </p><p>At Anasco, all brick buildings were destroyed or condemned. Several concrete structures with very little reinforcmenet were generally wrecked during aftershocks, but those which were well reinforced sustained little damage. Wood frame buildings were not damaged except where timbers had rotted.</p><p>At Aguadilla, most of the buildings on alluvium were badly damaged or destroyed. As a rule, masonry structures were badly cracked. </p><p>At Mayaguez, south of Anasco, the brick Catholic Church had to be razed, but the brick Presbyterian Church was only slightly damaged. Several persons were killed in the collapse of a two-story, poorly built, concrete cigar factory. </p><p>Many bridges were damaged; railroad tracks were bent and displaced; pipelines and flumes were wrecked; and tall brick chimneys were thrown down. Two cable links were broken in Mona Pasage. </p><p><b>Tsunami Damage</b> (from Reference #1182):</p><p>Before the tsunami arrived, the ocean withdrew and exposed reefs and stretches of seafloor never visible during low tide. A tsunami with runup heights reaching 6 m followed the earthquake, causing extensive damage along the western and northern coasts of Puerto Rico, especially to those villages established in a flood plain. </p><p><b>Deaths and Total Damage:</b></p><p>The official death toll attributed to both earthquake and tsunami was 116 persons according to Reference #1078. Reference #1492 said, &#34;Since more than 100 perished at Mayaguez, plus 4 at Ponce, plus 40 tsunami deaths at northwestern Puerto Rico, the tally would have been more than 116. The greatest number of fatalities was said to be due to the tsunami.&#34; Reference #1591 reported 91 killed by the tsunami in northwestern Puerto Rico.</p><p>References #1128 and #1492 list $4 million damage in Puerto Rico; Reference #1250 lists $29 million damage.</p><p>In Mayaguez most stone buildings either fell or were very badly damaged. Many streets were made impassable with debris. The Science building of the Agricultural College was destroyed by fire. More than one hundred deaths occurred in Mayaguez. <b>In Ponce many  buildings were seriously damaged, including\r\nthe theatre and the Cathedral.

On April 14 and 18, 1928, earthquakes of magnitude 6.75 originated in southern Bulgaria, resulting in what has been called the most serious earthquake calamity in the history of that country. The epicenter of the earlier shock was near Chirpan, where there was great destruction; that of the latter was somewhat farther west near Popovitsa (Papazli). Faults were produced with maximum throw of 3 to 4 meters. (refe #1006)\r\n</p><p>1928, April 14 to 18 [effects listed with April 14 event]. Intensity XI.

The earthquake was preceded by foreshocks the largest of which occurred on 14 April (09:30, 42.15\u00b0 N, 25.28\u00b0 E, M &#61; 6.8) and it was also destructive. It was followed by many aftershocks the largest of which occurred on 25 April (09:25:, M &#61; 5.7). These earthquakes caused large destructions in Philippoupole, Tsipran and Papasli. In Philippoupole 8,000 houses collapsed. Totally 74,570 houses were overturned in 240 cities and villages. 127 people were killed and 1,735 were injured. During the generation of the earthquake of 14 April (M &#61;6.8), two parallel normal faults were created in the ground with an east-west direction, a distance between them equal to about 15 km and a fall to the south side of the north fault and to the north side of the south fault by about 50 cm. The length of the north fault was equal to 38 km and of the south equal to 42 km. During the generation of the main shock (M &#61; 7.0), the ground rupture was extended more to the west and turned to the northwest. The total length of the rupture which was caused by the main shock was about 60 km while the northeast side of the fault was sunk by more than 3m near the village Popovitsa. In Komotine the earthquake caused the collapse of a house and fissures in walls. In Thessaloniki, it caused panic and fissures in the walls of some houses and of some building in the beach. In the area of Kapoutzidi two houses collapsed. The inhabitants got out of the houses and many of them spent the night in the open air. In Eleutheroupole, the police station collapsed. It was felt in several places of Greece. Some days before the earthquake the mineral springs around Philippoupole overflowed and the water that came out was very warm (Newspaper of Balkans, 19.4.1928; AOA, 1932; Sieberg, 1932b; Montandon, 1953; Richter, 1958). Isoseismals for the largest foreshock, for the main shock and for its largest aftershock are cited in the atlas of UNESCO (Shebalin et al., 1974b) and by Papazachos et al. (1997b).

        "comments": "1931, February 3 10:47 (local time). 39.5 N, 177 E. There was an earthquake [intensity IX] with source in Hawke Bay, which almost completely destroyed Napier and Hastings, and was felt over a considerable area. In the central region, the quake consisted of two shocks, the second being significantly stronger. Vibrations quickly intensified and continued for 2.5 minutes, making it difficult to stand upright. This earthquake turned out to be more severe than all previous quakes in New Zealand. More than 250 people perished in the quake and numerous aftershocks continued for more than a month.\r\n<p>Subsequent geological investigation revealed that the earthquake was apparently caused by a thrust in an easterly direction along a fault or system of faults having a northeastern attitude. The shore in the area of Napier lifted up 1.8 m, and 18 km farther north the lift diminished and in the area of Wairoa there was no uplift at all. The coast south of Napier sank 1/4 to 1 m. Subsequent depth sounding revealed that the uplift had also affected the bottom of the bay adjacent to Napier. The navigation channel in Napier became shallower by 1.8 m. Along the coast of Hawke Bay many cave-ins and landslides occurred.\r\n<br />(above from reference #415)\r\n</p><p>256 killed, $25 million damage. (reference #1250)\r\n</p><p>The Hawke&#39;s Bay earthquake of 3 February 1931 came like a &#39;bolt from the blue&#39;, a sudden catastrophe unpredicted by the science of the day... It seared itself indelibly into the memories of the 70,000-odd men, women and children living in Hawke&#39;s Bay that fateful summer... The toll was finally settled officially at 256--although, despite an outstanding effort, two people were never accounted for. Over 400 were hospitalized with serious injuries. At least 2500 were cut, bruised, scratched, and shocked, a toll never fully evaluated because few bothered to report trivial injuries to the authorities... The event is called the &#39;Napier&#39; or &#39;Hawkes Bay&#39; earthquake but it actually affected the whole depression-era New Zealand. The shock brought down buildings between Gisborne and Waipawa. It topped chimneys from Taupo to Wellington. (reference #9338)\r\n</p><p>Occurring at 10.47 a.m. [Note: this is Summer Time] on Tuesday, February 3rd, 1931, the Hawke&#39;s Bay earthquake is recorded as having caused the largest loss of life and the most extensive damage ever recorded in New Zealand. The effects of the earthquake were greatest in the towns of Napier and Hastings, but other towns in Hawke&#39;s Bay also suffered major damage. <b>The death toll has recently been reassessed at 261, with 121 in Napier and 97 in Hastings</b>. The earthquake was followed by fires in the business areas of both Napier and Hastings, the fires becoming uncontrollable as the water pressure dwindled because of broken water mains. (reference #11746)\r\n</p><p>Extensive damage, hitherto unreported, along the coast between Napier and Wairoa, and on the [?]arming and Crown lands between those two centres, was revealed to the &#34;Star&#34; correspondent in the course of a trip by air over that country.

Faults up to 12 km long were formed. 5 villages including Ierissos were razed to the ground in the region of the Mt Athos. 3,000 houses were destroyed; 341 people were killed. Numerous new shocks took place including some that caused victims within the region of Thessaloniki. 10,000 people lost their dwellings. The damage in the region of the Mt Athos was estimated at 5 million drachmae. Many houses crumbled in Dhrama, Kavala, and other settlements to the north of the focal area. The operator of a seagoing dredge anchored in the River Strimonas 1 km from its estuary was disturbed from his sleep.

In Antimachia nearly all the houses collapsed. The village of Kardamena was almost entirely destroyed, while the Cathedral and other four small churches suffered damage and needed repair. In Asfendiou moderate damage was reported. In Kefalos, at the westernmost side of the island, little damage was reported but the St. George church also needed repair after the earthquake.\r\n</p><p>From a collection of press reports (Aggelis 2003) it results that damage was also caused in the villages Emporio, Pali, Mandraki and Nikia at Nissyros Isl.

Slight damage in houses was reported from Bodrum, SW Turkey.\r\n</p><p>As regards the level of mortality caused by the 1933 earthquake there is a remarkable variability in the several documents examined. According to Mourikis (1934), 200 persons were killed and 600 injured. Papazachos and Papazachou (1997, 2003) adopted these figures from Mourikis (1934) although the last is not a quite reliable author for the reason that his earthquake catalog does not provide information sources [...]In the Album of Kos (Manousis 1934), various estimates can be found with the number of casualties ranging from 200 or 300 and up to several hundreds, but only 122 names of people killed were listed. The estimated number of injuries varies from 600 up to a few thousands[...]collection and evaluation of various press reports, however, Aggelis (2003) estimated that in Kos 149 persons perished and more than 600 were injured. A careful examination of official archives by Chatzivasiliou (1990) showed that in Kos city the total number of victims reached 178[...]Therefore, we adopted that the total number of victims caused by the 1933 earthquake reached 181, while a realistic estimate of the total number of injuries would be around 600.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #10476:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>05:57:34.97 UTC, 36.759 N 27.299 E, depth 15, 6.43 Mw \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #9910:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>05:57:37.44 UTC, 36.516 N, 27.15 E, depth 35, 6.8 magnitude</p>",

Among the areas which suffered were Istrios, Monolithos and Rhodes. In Turkey, along the mast near the focus, damage was particularly severe, being due in the main to the strongest shock, that of 25 April at 02.25 h : 80 per cent of the buildings were damaged or destroyed in the little port of Fethiye, where the casualties were 18 killed and 70 injured; other damage was reported at Golenye (40 per cent of houses), at Dalaman (30 per cent), at Marmaris (20 per cent), where 43 buildings collapsed (Pinar). The press reported the collapse of a mosque at Antalya, causing 7 injured, as well as the destruction of houses, and 4 injured at Milos. In all, 3,000 houses were made uninhabitable, and 5,000 slightly damaged.</p>",

The series of earthquakes that followed ravaged southern Chile and ruptured over a period of days a 1,000 km section of the fault, one of the longest ruptures ever reported. The number of fatalities associated with both the earthquake and tsunami has been estimated to be between 490 and 5,700. Reportedly there were 3,000 injured, and initially there were 717 missing in Chile. The Chilean government estimated 2,000,000 people were left homeless and 58,622 houses were completely destroyed. Damage (including tsunami damage) was more than $500 million U.S. dollars.</p><p>The main shock generated a tsunami that was not only destructive along the coast of Chile, but also caused numerous casualties and extensive property damage in Hawaii and Japan, and was noticeable along shorelines throughout the Pacific Ocean area. There were several other geologic phenomena besides tsunamis associated with this event. Subsidence caused by the earthquake produced local flooding and permanently altered the shorelines of much of the area in Chile impacted by the earthquake rendering all marine navigational charts of the affected areas obsolete. Landslides were common on Chilean hillsides. The Puyehue volcano erupted forty-seven hours after the main shock.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #9910:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1960, May 22, 19:11:17.75 UTC. 38.235 S, 73.047 W, 35 km depth, 9.5 M GSX, 9.6 Mw P&amp;S, 8.5 Ms ABE1, 8.5 Ms P&amp;S, 7.9 mB ABE1, 8.3 Ms ROTHE. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #10476:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1960, May 22, 19:11:20.70 UTC. 38.143 S, 73.407 W, 25 km depth, 9.6 Mw. \r\n</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><br /><b><h2>Different Reports of Epicenters, Magnitudes and Effects</h2></b>\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td>\r\n\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Latitude</b></td><td><b>Longitude</b></td><td><b>Magnitude</b></td><td><b>Intensity</b>\r\n</td><td><b>$Million<br />Damage</b></td><td><b>Deaths<br />(Total)</b></td><td><b>Injuries<br />(Total)</b></td><td><b>Deaths<br />(Earthquake)</b></td><td><b>Deaths<br />(Tsunami)</b></td><td><b>Reference #</b></td></tr><tr><td>37.2S</td><td>73.2W</td><td></td><td></td><td>550<br />(earthquake)<br />50<br />(tsunami)</td><td>7231</td><td>3000</td><td>6000</td><td>1231</td><td>1250</td></tr><tr><td>39.5S</td><td>74.5W</td><td>8.5</td><td></td><td>550</td><td>2231</td><td>3000</td><td>2000</td><td>231</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>38S</td><td>73.5W</td><td>8.4</td><td>XII</td><td>417</td><td>1500</td><td></td><td>500</td><td>1000</td><td>3434</td></tr><tr><td>39.5S</td><td>74.5W</td><td></td><td></td><td>800</td><td>3000</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1231</td></tr><tr><td>39.5S</td><td>74.5W</td><td></td><td></td><td>880</td><td>3000</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1051</td></tr><tr><td>39.5S</td><td>74.5W</td><td>8.6</td><td></td><td>1000<br />(tsunami)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2000</td><td>164</td></tr><tr><td>39.5S</td><td>74.5W</td><td>8.6</td><td></td><td>75<br />(tsunami)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1263</td><td>237</td></tr><tr><td>41S</td><td>73.5W</td><td>8.5</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1260</td><td>415</td></tr><tr><td>39.5S</td><td>74.5W</td><td>8.5</td><td>XI</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1206</td></tr><tr><td>41S</td><td>73.5W</td><td>8.25-8.5</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>9.5 Mw</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1314</td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n",

        "comments": "The Makarska earthquake is one of the most important seismic sequences in Croatia in the last 50 years. The main shock occurred between the main land and the islands of Hvar and Bra\u010d, at a depth between 5 and 20 km. The earthquake caused a vertical sea-bottom displacement of 15 cm and a sea-floor deformation on the order of 10 km (Herak et al. 2001). Several newspapers reported that the earthquake was also felt at sea. \u0091At 7:15 am the ship Vladimir Nazor which runs regularly between Plo\u010de and Split, sailed into the Makarska port. At the time of the earthquake the boat was somewhat more than one (nautical) mile away from the coast, in the direction of Igrane. All the crew has declared that they felt a bump, as if the boat had stranded in full speed against an underwater ridge. All those that were sleeping at the time in their cabins or in the parlour, were awaken by the strength of the shock. \u0085According to the first engine-man Josip Bergam, at the time of the earthquake the steam ship (Budva) was just coming into the port of Igrane. They were about 100 m away from the quay. They felt a strong shock, which was twice as strong as the one they felt at sea on Sunday.-I was in the engine-room, Josip Bergam told us-and the first thing of what I thought was that we had run in full speed into underwater cliffs and that the ship is mounting onto the coast&#39; (Vjesnik 1962). In another report we read \u0091The earthquake was also felt at sea, so cap. Juraj Boric\u00b4, the captain of m/b Gusar, helmsman Josip Vela and the sailors, were thrown out of their beds while the ship was at the quay in Podgora \u0085 On board ship Takovo, which was at the time at sea between Sumartin and Split, 150 passengers felt a strong shock and the sea became disturbed. Also the passengers, who happened to be yesterday morning on board ship Vuk Karad\u009eic\u00b4, felt the shock from the earthquake, while the ship was passing through the strait of Splitska Vrata&#39; (Slobodna Dalmacija 1962, of 12/01). Strong shaking was also felt in the island of Bra\u010d: \u0091The sea also trembled like water in a saucepan. The sailors from the ship Takovo, which was at the time of the earthquake in the port of Sumartin on the island of Bra\u010d, say that the earthquake was also felt at sea-they call it maremoto-the sea was trembling like water in a saucepan, they say&#39; (Slobodna Dalmacija 1962, of 14/01).<p> (above reference #11164)\r\n</p><p>It began on 7 January 1962 with a foreshock of ML 5.9. The mainshock occurred four days later, on 11 January at 05:05. It had a magnitude ML 6.1, and the largest estimated intensity was VIII. The greatest damage was observed in villages and towns on and beneath the Biokovo Mt. in the Makarska municipality, on the central Adriatic islands (Hvar, Brac, Korcula, Lastovo) and on the Peljesac peninsula. The whole epicentral area was evacuated after the mainshock. The contemporary reports (e.g., Bozicevic, 1962) state that 2290 houses were left destroyed to the level of being unsuitable for living in, 78 schools and other public buildings were damaged, as well as 6 km of roads. Over 100 earthquakes were felt in the shaken area in the first week alone. (reference #2862)\r\n</p><p>The two largest events of 7 January and 11 January had magnitudes of M &#61; 5.9 and M &#61; 6.1, and were felt with\r\nintensities of 8 and 8-9 MCS, respectively. The earthquakes caused large damage in the Biokovo area, and practically define the earthquake hazard there.

(reference #1040)\r\n</p><p>A magnitude 5.4 earthquake took place in the early morning hours of July 26, 1963, with an epicenter near Skopje, capital of Macedonia in Yugoslavia. The earthquake was characterized by an extremely high destructiveness to\r\npoorly designed but recently built office buildings, hotels, and apartment houses in the center of the city. Over <b>1,000 persons were killed</b>, and 80% of the city of 200,000 were left homeless. This unduly high degree of damage can be attributed to the complete disregard of aseismic design criteria, which led to the collapse of many multistory brick bearing-wall structures, intensity of VIII (Modified Mercalli 1931) was the highest noted; the seismic ground effects common to intensities higher than VIII were absent. Skopje is located on the flood plain of the Vardar River, within the highly active Vardar Tectonic Zone, which has a we11 documented history of destructive earthquakes. Since soil conditions of the terraces of the Vardar River are superior to those of the flood plain, the amount of damage to structures on the terraces was limited. The damage was mostly confined to the relatively small area of the lowest level of the flood plain.

There was <b>1 death and 60 injured</b>, 4 of whom seriously; numerous landslides and ground fractures were noticed.\r\n</p><p>The Greek seismological service published the following in its bulletin of February 1966:\r\n<br />An exceptionally long sequence of small local shocks with exponentially increasing frequency preceded the principal shock. The sequence started after the damming of the Akheloos River and the impounding of the artificial Lake Kremasta. It was found that the numbers of the foreshocks could be correlated with increasing of reservoir loading. There seem, therefore, to be good reasons for believing that the tectonic equilibrium in the area of Kremasta was sufficiently ripe to be disturbed by this comparatively minor additional unilateral load. The weight of the water in the new lake is of the order of 4.7 x 10<sup>9</sup> tons. </p><p>Evritania is a seismic region, but from 1951 to 1965 the epicentres were localized in the lower Akheloos valley, about 40 km downstream from the dam. This dam, built across the Akheloos near the Kremasta thermal springs, started filling with water on 21 July 1965. From November 1965, the level of the lake rose rapidly; the first tremors were felt in January 1966 and the principal shock occurred on 5 February when the lake had almost reached its maximum height: the depth of the water was then about 120 metres. Numerous aftershocks (more than 160) were felt or recorded; they were localized either near the lake or in the mountainous area to the north-east of the dam; at least 5 of the aftershocks were of magnitude greater than 5: 5 February, 8 March, 3 April, 4 May, and 11 June. \r\n</p><p>The lake rests on eocene-oligocene flysch; however, about 11 km to the north of the dam, the lake covers an area of large faults at the contact between the flysch and the Jurassic limestone of Gavrovon: it is in this latter area that the premonitory tremors and the strongest aftershocks occurred. A further violent tremor occurred on 29 October, 1966.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1039)</p>",

The earthquake of 29 July 1967 (No. 554) caused severe losses in the region of Caracas: 240 dead and missing, 1,536 injured, very severe damage evaluated at $50 million. The loss of life was mainly due to the collapse of four large buildings of 10-12 storeys, constructed between 1962 and 1966. In fact, the earthquake was of relatively minor intensity (magnitude6.5), and of the 808 high-rise buildings in Caracas, only 161 showed signs of damage: 10 had to be demolished. It is notable that the damage to large modern buildings was more severe than that suffered by the small, poorly constructed houses in the less prosperous parts of the city. There was no superficial faulting. There was also severe damage on the coast near Caracas; several hotels were affected, more or less severely according to the nature of the foundations and subsoil. (reference #1039)\r\n</p><p>The event has a reported magnitude of MW 6.6, causing more than 270 fatalities and 1500 injuries. (reference #12788)\r\n</p><p>29 July 1967, 300 deaths, 140 million in losses (reference #1051)\r\n</p><p>On 29 July 1967, at 8 p,m. local time, an earthquake occurred off the coast of Venezuela north of Caracas which was of moderate magnitude (m 6.1) and of intermediate focal depth (102 km) (reference #1080)</p>",

Estimates indicate the shallow-depth shock took over 11,000 lives, injured thousands and left upwards of 100,000 homeless.

Among the places which suffered most was Dasht-e Bayaz, where there were 3,000 dead out of a total population of 3,500. At Kakhk, a small town of 4,400 inhabitants, almost all the houses in adobe (sunbaked brick) were destroyed, with the exception of a group of about sixty houses; 3,000 persons were buried under the ruins. At Ferdows, already damaged by the first shock, the greatest destruction was caused by the aftershock on 1 September, whose epicentre was very close to the town; 1,500 houses out of a total of 2,300 were totally destroyed and at least 700 persons were killed. More or less severe damage was reported at Gonabad, Qayen and Birjand, where public buildings in masonry stood up to the earthquake but where many houses collapsed, as did two mosques dating from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

The place worst hit was Buaran, about 6 km west of Bumiayu; further, in Bantar Kawung and Jipang, respectively some 12 and 17 km west of Bumiayu, most brick buildings suffered considerable damage. In the affected area 1377 buildings sustained damage; wooden houses generally resisted shaking but some poorly constructed buildings slanted toward east or west and some collapsed completely. Despite this only one person was reported killed and 6 injured. The damage might have been due to old structures made of brick which are not well cemented and are without reinforcing iron rods. The unconsolidated river deposits may largely be responsible. (reference #1188)</p>",

According to Ammianus, this great earthquake struck various places and many walls of the city collapsed together with 57 towers. Huge blocks of stone and a number of statues collapsed. Starvation and a noxious smell in the air killed many thousands of people and cattle. Many cities were reduced to ruins. Evagrios records that many towers in different parts of the imperial city were knocked down and the long wall of the Chersonese (Callipole) was reduced to ruins. The earth opened and swallowed up many villages and innumerable other calamities happened both by land and sea. Fountains became dry and large areas of water formed on the surface, where none had existed before. Entire trees were torn up by the roots and hurled into the air and mountains were suddenly formed by the accumulation of masses thrown up. The sea also cast up dead fish, many islands were submerged and ships were seen stranded by the retreat of the waters. At the same time Bithynia, the Hellespont and both Phrygias suffered  severely. The calamity lasted for considerable time.  Malalas writes that during the reign of Theodosios II\r\nNicomedia suffered its fifth calamity and was razed to the ground and flooded by the sea. Theodosios built many buildings here including the public baths, the colonnades, the harbour, the public arenas, the martyrium of St. Anthimus and all the city&#39;s churches. During his reign Constantinople suffered for the first time. The Chronicon Paschale adds that fire had been seen in the heavens too. Nicephoros Callistos, a very late source, adds that earthquakes lasted for 6 months. (ref #4408)\r\n</p><p>447, January 26. Constantinople, Nicomedea. There was a destructive earthquake on Sunday night, 26 January 447, which affected a large area that included parts of the provinces of Bithynia, of the two Phyrgiae and of the Hellespont, where it is said that many towns were ruined, about which, however nothing is known in detail. In Constantinople, public buildings and houses collapsed, particularly in the region between the Toad Emvola (Forum Theodosii) and the Bronze Tetrapylon... The shock caused general panic and the people left the city and camped outside, the emperor praying with the people and the clergy remaining barefoot for many days. Many people and animals perished in the aftermath of the earthquake from famine and disease... The shock was possibly followed by a sea wave casting ships and fish onto the land, although this is not certain... With the army of Attila approaching, the walls of the city were rebuilt in a matter of two months, which suggests that the damage was not all that great, some of these repairs being recorded by extant inscriptions. The land walls were repaired all along their 5-km length from the Marmara coast to the coast of the Golden Horn in 60 days... Marcellinus Comes, although he gives the same AD 447, records a famine and plague after the earthquake, which killed thousands. Admittedly this is separate from the earthquake, and Marcellinus does not say that anyone was killed in the earthquake, although in view of the extent of the damage, it is hard to believe that there were no deaths... <b>evidence points strongly to an earthquake on Sunday 26 January. The only year during Theodosius&#39;s reign in which the 26 January fell on a Sunday was AD4 447, which would indicate that this event was not a later event on 26 January AD 450</b>...

Recurrent shocks continued almost without interruption until 4:30 on the 6th. Less frequent shocks were felt for many days. The fortifications and other stone structures on the hill near Gunungsitoli were almost completely destroyed. Trees were ripped up and broken; the ground cracked and mud flowed from the crevices. The earthquake apparently spread to Singapore and Penang Island. Before the earthquake, the sea off Nias Island was absolutely calm. Suddenly, at 0:30, a terrible wave advanced from the southeast with a terrifying noise. It affected the entire coast of the island and destroyed everything in its path.

The port of Omoa was almost totally destroyed. Many cracks appeared in the walls of the ancient Spanish fortress. The ground cracked in a radius of 50 km (12 leagues) in the vicinity of the city and on the coast between the Rio Tinto and Ulua Rivers. The town of San Jose was also destroyed, and Beliz suffered damage. Weak tremors lasting 30 seconds were felt at Guatemala. Underground shocks lasted all the night of the 4th-5th. Then for a week more than a hundred were counted, and they lasted at least until the 27th. The Indian tribes of Honduras long remembered this earthquake. At Omoa, the sea fell and rose to a height of 5 m in still weather; it reached the foot of the fortress and added to the destruction begun by the earthquake. A similar phenomenon was observed on the shore of Criba lagoon. (ref #415)\r\n<p>August 4-14, 1856. Gulf of Honduras.

The houses but not the population were damaged...  At those moments one has seen rare phenomena, as much in the sea as in earth.

However, at Omoa the sea rose 5 m. at the base of the fort. \r\n<br />R. A. White states that ... based upon reports, almost certainly 1856 was a rupture on the Swan fracture zone. It must have extended from Omoa, Honduras, to or nearly to the Cayman spreading center, which is about 365 km west of Jamaica and represents a rupture length of 500 to 600\r\nkm.

Tsunami in Acre, and possibly nearby coast.\r\nRegarding the cause of the tsunami, Amiran (ref#10419) mention a swarm of earthquakes during the winter of 1033/4, probably in the Jordan Valley, including the strongest shock on 1033 12 10 and another one on 1034 01 04. Ambraseys (ref#10421) and Ambraseys (ref#3845) also locate the earthquake in the Jordan Valley but date it on 1033 12 05. Guidoboni (ref#10420) suggests that the earthquake occurred on 1033 12 05, although Arabic sources give the date of 1033 12 05 as 1034 01 04. In their opinion, Perrey (ref#10418) dated this event to 1032 03 06, which is then further confused with 1033 03 06, the date of the earthquake that occurred in Constantinople. (ref #10416)<p>1033, Dec 5. A damaging earthquake occurred in Palestine. Much of the damage was sustained in Ramla, Nablus, Baniyas and Jericho. In Ramla, 1/3 to 1/2 of its houses collapsed... many people were killed. In Nablus 1/2 of the buildings collapsed, killing about 300 people, and the surrounding country was almost totally destroyed. A landslide overwhelmed a neighbouring village of al-Badan, with all its people and its livestock; other villages met the same safe. At least half of Banyas fell down.. Half of Balash collapsed and in Syria the earth swallowed up many places with their inhabitants. Jericho sustained equally heavy damage, with the loss of life.. In Jerusalem damage was widespread... The victims reached a considerable number, which is not given. (ref #9116)</p><p>1033, Nov 26-1034, Nov 16. Many earthquakes took place during this year. In Syria 1/3 of Ramla was destroyed. The walls of Jerusalem collapsed and the Temple was severely damaged. The mosque and its minarets at El-Gaalan at Gaza were destroyed and the upper part of the lighthouse of Gaza was badly damaged.(ref #1098)</p><p>1033-1034. Int X-XI. In Syria, 1/3 of Ramala was destroyed. In Jerusalem the walls collapsed and the temple was severely destroyed. In Ghaza the mosque and its minarets at El Gaalan were destroyed also upper part of lighthouse badly damaged. In Nablus 1/2 of the city fell down, many villages in El Badou were swallowed up in the ground. In Egypt the earthquake caused much damage. There were 70,000 victims. (ref #1222) </p><p>1034, Jan 4; or Mar 6, 1032; 1039; or May 1035. A strong destructive earthquake occurred in the vast region from Syria in the northeast to Egypt in the southwest. Half of the city of Nablus and 1/3 of the city of Ramallah were destroyed. In Jerusalem, walls were destroyed, the temple was badly damaged, other buildings suffered damage. In Gaza the mosque and the lighthouse were damaged, heavy damage was caused in Ashkelon. After one or several earthquakes the sea retreated from the shore and returned swiftly. Tidal waves were observed in Gaza and in Ashkelon. The seaport of Akko became dry for a long time, then it was half destroyed by a wave. (ref #2130)</p><p>1035, April or May.

Felt (V) in Singapore.\r\n<p><b>Tectonic Summary</b>\r\n<br />\r\nThe Java earthquake of September 02, 2009, occurred at a depth of about 50 km as a result of reverse faulting. The tectonics of Java are dominated by the subduction of the Australia plate north-northeastward beneath the Sunda plate, with a relative velocity of 59 mm/year at the longitude of the earthquake. Although the September 02 shock&#39;s hypocenter would place it near the subduction interface between the Australia and Sunda plate, the orientation of the causative fault that is inferred from the seismic wave radiation-pattern is inconsistent with the shock occurring as interplate faulting on that interface. Instead, the earthquake likely occurred as the result of faulting within the subducting Australia plate.\r\n\r\nThe region of the plate boundary between the Australia plate and Sunda plate is seismically highly active, with past strong earthquakes having occurred within each of the Australia and Sunda plates as well as on the plate interface. The magnitude 7.8 earthquake of June 2, 1994 and the magnitude 7.7 earthquake of July 17, 2006, both of which occurred south of Java and both of which produced destructive tsunamis, occurred as the result of thrust faulting on the shallow plate interface near the Java trench. The devastating Yogyakarta earthquake of May 26, 2006, magnitude 6.3, occurred at shallow depth within the overriding Sunda plate. The magnitude 7.5 Java earthquake of August 28, 2007, occurred at a depth of about 290 km within the subducted Australia plate. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nA devastating earthquake with a 7.3-magnitude hit West Java province of Indonesia on 2 September. So far 74 deaths have been officially confirmed, Priyadi Kardono, a spokesman for Indonesia&#39;s Disaster Management Agency, told Agence France-Presse. Officials said, the death toll may is likely to go up and even touch 100 as more bodies are being recovered.\r\nOver 88,000 people have been left homeless by the quake, which struck off the south coast of Java and badly damaged over 54,000 homes and buildings.

This earthquake occurred several hundred kilometers north of the convergent India:Eurasia plate boundary, where the Indian Plate is moving northwards with respect to Eurasia at a rate of approximately 46 mm/yr. This convergence drives the uplift of the Himalaya Mountains, at a rate of approximately 10 mm/yr, and the Tibetan Plateau, which is an extremely broad region of thickened and uplifted crust sitting above 4.5-5 km.\r\n</p><p>In the region of the April 13 earthquake the Tibetan Plateau is extending and translating east-southeastward within a larger zone of generally north-south convergence. Based on the location, depth, and moment tensor of the event, the Qinghai Province earthquake likely reflects the interplay amongst these major tectonic forces, dominated in this location by southeastward translation. The eastward motion of Tibet with respect to Eurasia further north is accommodated in part by the large intra-continental Altyn Tagh and Kunlun strike-slip fault systems. Several large historic events in the Qinghai Province have occurred on the Kunlun fault, which runs west-east approximately 300 km to the north of the April 13 event. The April 13 earthquake is one of the largest known historic earthquakes within several hundred kilometers of its location. In 1738, a nearby earthquake of approximately magnitude 6.5 caused over 300 fatalities. </p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>The death toll from last week&#39;s 6.9-magnitude earthquake in northwest China has risen to 2,039, state media said late Monday. Another 195 people were still missing, the state-run Xinhua news agency said, citing rescue headquarters. It added that 12,135 people were injured, of whom 1,434 were in serious condition. The earthquake toppled about 15,000 homes in and around the impoverished county of Yushu, and caused more than 100,000 people to flee the area. Qinghai province is home to about 5 million people and is considered a gateway to Himalayan Tibet.

Mariana (1601) only says that in the year 218 B.C. there were several earthquakes in Spain. Moreira (1758) follows Mariana (1601) and dates an earthquake in 218 B.C. The catalogue of Mart\u0131nez-Solares and Mezcua (2002) places an earthquake in SW of Saint Vincent Cape and dates it in 218 B.C., following Moreira (1758). As the first reference is that of Ocampo (1543), <b>the year must be 216 B.C. </b> Here, again, we have reference to earthquakes and flooding in Cadiz, which may correspond to the occurrence of large earthquakes followed by tsunamis in the area of Saint Vincent Cape. Lack of references by more or less contemporary Roman authors could lead to think that Ocampo (1543) mention of the earthquakes of 241 B.C. and 216 B.C. could refer to the same event or events which may have taken place around the middle of the thirteenth century B.C. (reference #12772)\r\n</p><p>218 (217, 216) B.C. To find the correct year, in the beginning of chapter 40 Ocampo says &#34;As it arrived the beginning of the following year that was the year 216 before Our Lord Jesus Christ&#34;(Llegado el principio del ano siguiente que fue 216 antes de N.S. Jesucristo). In chapter 45he says &#34;four months after he moved from Cartagena&#34;, therefore the events related in chapter 44 are in the same year 216 B.C. not two years before in 218 B.C. [...]the historical reference is weak. Ocampo and Mariana talk about large earthquakes together with other prodigious signs with predicted the future disasters that affected Spain caused by the war between the Roman and Carthaginians; the mention of earthquakes may be only a literary tool with no factual evidence.

The convergence of the two plates is broadly accommodated by the uplift of the Himalaya and the Tibetan Plateau, and by the motion of crustal material to the east away from the sides of the Tibetan Plateau.\r\n</p><p>The July 21, 2013 event occurred within 200km of 3 events greater than M 6 in the past 40 years, including one event of M 6.0 in 2008.</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>BEIJING -  A strong earthquake that shook an arid, hilly farming area in northwest China sparked landslides and destroyed or damaged thousands of brick-and-mud homes Monday, killing at least 75 people and injuring more than 400, the government said.\r\nThe quake near the city of Dingxi in Gansu province toppled brick walls and telephone lines, shattered mud-and-tile-roofed houses and sent cascades of dirt and rock down hillsides that blocked roads and slowed rescue efforts by crews trying to reach remote areas.\r\nHospitals set up aid stations in parking lots to accommodate large numbers of injured, while hundreds of paramilitary People&#39;s Armed Police fanned out to search for victims in the region of terraced farmland where the quake struck about 1,200 kilometers (760 miles) west of Beijing.

Preliminary faulting mechanisms for the event indicate slip occurred on either a SSE-NNW trending left-lateral fault, or on a WSW-ENE trending right lateral structure. The location of the earthquake and orientation of the WSW-ENE nodal plane are consistent with right-lateral faulting within the North Aegean Trough. Right-lateral strike-slip faults within this trough (also called the Saros Trough at its eastern extent) and the surrounding region accommodate the westward motion of Turkey and associated southwestward motion of the Aegean region with respect to Eurasia. Faults within the North Aegean Trough represent the northern branch of the North Anatolian fault system, the major transform faulting structure in northern Turkey accommodating the westward motion of the Anatolian microplate with respect to Eurasia, at a rate of approximately 25 mm/yr...</p><p>Seismotectonics of the Mediterranean Region and Vicinity<br />The Mediterranean region is seismically active due to the northward convergence (from 4 mm/yr at the Strait of Gibraltar to 10 mm/yr near western Turkey) of the Africa (AF) plate with respect to the Eurasia (EU) plate, along an east-west trending boundary. This plate boundary is complex, comprising segments of subduction and associated back-arc extension, continental collision, and transform faults. AF-EU convergence began at approximately 50 Ma and was associated with the closure of the Tethys Sea as it subducted northward beneath Eurasia; the Mediterranean Sea is the modern remnant of the Tethys.<i>..</i></p><p><i>Ref #10978:</i><br />The quake caused 266 injuries in Turkey, including one person who was in serious condition, according to the government&#39;s emergency and disaster management agency.

At the location of this earthquake, Nubia converges with Eurasia at a rate of 9mm/yr towards the north-northwest. Nubian lithosphere subducts beneath the Aegean Sea along the Hellenic Arc, to the south of Crete and southeast of the November 17 earthquake. Farther west, plate motion becomes more oblique as the plate boundary rotates clockwise, until the boundary is dominantly transform in the region of this earthquake. Preliminary focal mechanisms for the earthquake indicate it occurred as the result of either northwest striking, left-lateral faulting or northeast striking, right-lateral slip; left-lateral faulting would be consistent with the orientation of the local plate boundary. Right-lateral faulting would also be consistent with other regional, non-plate boundary faults in the region; further studies of this event will be required to determine the causative faulting structure.\r\n</p><p>The region surrounding Greece is frequently impacted by moderate-to-large earthquakes like the November 17, 2015 event, and 14 other earthquakes of M6.5 or larger have occurred within 250 km of the November 17 event over the last century. The largest was a M 7.0 in January 1983, 85 km to the south, which did not cause any known fatalities. A M 6.3 event in August 2003, just 20 km to the north-northwest, also did not result in any known fatalities, though a M 6.5 earthquake in June 1995, 160 km to the east of the November 17, 2015 event, resulted in over 20 fatalities and 60 injuries.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of at least 6.1 hit the western Greek island of Lefkada on Tuesday, killing two people and causing extensive damage to infrastructure and buildings on Lefkada and nearby islands.\r\nThe temblor was felt across western Greece, which is very earthquake-prone, with people on Lefkada and the nearby Ionian Sea island of Kefalonia rushing out onto the streets... Greek authorities were struggling to assess the damage, their efforts hampered by landslides that blocked Lefkada&#39;s network of narrow, mountainous roads. The fire department said an 82-year-old woman was killed in the village of Athani when a wall collapsed on her. And a 69-year-old woman died in her home in another village when a boulder loosened by the earthquake tumbled down onto her house. Four people were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. State ERT TV said part of the harbor of Vassiliki in the worst-hit southwestern part of the island was submerged in the sea. Schools were shut on both Lefkada and Kefalonia as a precaution. Authorities said several houses were badly damaged on Kefalonia and another nearby island, Ithaca. (reference #11305)\r\n</p><p>Roads in the south-east of the Ionian island, closest to the earthquake&#39;s epicentre in the sea, and several stone houses, have been damaged, Kaliforis said.

        "comments": "The August 8, 2017, M 6.5 earthquake in northern Sichuan, China, occurred as the result of shallow strike-slip faulting in the interior of the Eurasia plate. Focal mechanism solutions indicate the event occurred on either a southeast striking left-lateral fault or on a southwest striking right-lateral fault. This earthquake occurred several hundred kilometers to the northeast of the convergent India:Eurasia plate boundary, where the India plate is moving northward with respect to Eurasia at a rate of approximately 46 mm/yr. This convergence drives the uplift of the Himalaya Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau, a broad region of thickened and uplifted crust, at a rate of approximately 10 mm/yr. The uplifted Tibetan Plateau is spreading to the east and, as a result, is an area of east-west extension and eastward crustal motion within a larger region of generally north-south convergence. At the edge of the plateau to the east of this earthquake, Tibetan crust is converging with the strong crust underlying the Sichuan Basin and southeastern China. The August 8th earthquake likely reflects the interplay among these major tectonic forces. The region within 250 km of the August 8, 2017, earthquake has experienced 12 events of M6&#43; over the past century. Most notable in the recent past was the May 12, 2008 M 7.9 Chengdu or Sichuan earthquake, just under 250 km to the south of the August 8, 2017 event. That 2008 earthquake resulted in over 69,000 fatalities and close to 400,000 injuries, destroying over 5 million buildings and affecting over 45 million people across western China. The 2008 earthquake and its prominent aftershock sequence occurred on the Longmenshan fault zone, a prominent structure along the range front to the south and southeast of the 2017 earthquake. In August 1976, three large earthquakes of M 6.9, M 6.4 and M 6.7 struck the region around 50 km to the southeast of today&#39;s earthquake. Perhaps due to the relative remoteness of this region, the 1976 earthquakes are not known to have caused any damage or fatalities. At least 23 people killed, 493 injured and 31,500 displaced; many buildings damaged; power outages and landslides occurred in Jiuzhaigou.(ref #1053)\r\n<p>The 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck Sichuan province late on Tuesday, tearing cracks in mountain highways, triggering rockslides, damaging buildings and sending panicked residents and tourists fleeing into the open.

The eight people were killed when two buildings and some houses collapsed in two towns in Pampanga province. Provincial governor Lilia Pineda told ABS-CBN News three bodies were pulled out of a four-storey building that housed a supermarket in Porac, while an old woman and her grandchild died after they were pinned by a wall in Lubao. Three others whose homes collapsed died in hospitals, she added. Dozens were rescued from the building in Porac. But at least 30 more were still trapped inside. GMA News reported that two of those who died were children. (reference #12405)\r\n<p>At least 16 people were killed while 112 others were injured following Monday afternoon&#39;s magnitude 6.1 earthquake that struck several areas in Luzon, authorities said on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters before the situation briefing here with President Rodrigo Duterte, Health Secretary Franisco Duque 3rd said that the 15 deaths were from Pampanga, while one was from Zambales[...]rescuers were still looking for 15 people who were reported missing following the quake. Of the 15 missing, 14 are believed to be trapped at the collapsed Chuzon Supermarket in Barangay Cangatba in Porac, Pampanga, while one was missing in Zambales. In its report released to the media earlier on Tuesday, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) said of the 15 dead, five were from Chuzon; seven from other villages, also in Porac; two from Lubao; and one in Angeles City. The NDRRMC said the lone death in Zambales was from San Marcelino[...]The NDRRMC also reported that 29 structures and buildings sustained damage following the strong quake.

The preliminary w-phase focal mechanism solution for the earthquake indicate slip occurred on either a shallow plane dipping towards the northwest, or on a steep plane dipping towards the southeast. The body wave focal mechanism solution also shows an oblique, or horizontal component to slip on similarly oriented fault planes. At the location of this earthquake, the India plate is moving northward with respect to Eurasia at a rate of approximately 38 mm/yr. \r\n</p><p>The January 19, 2020, earthquake is located several hundred kilometers north of the India:Eurasia plate boundary, on the southern edge of the Tian Shan Mountains and on the northern edge of the Taklimakan Desert. The collision of these two plates drives the tectonics of the broad region surrounding the Himalayan Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau, and causes uplift that produces the highest mountain peaks in the world including the Himalayan, the Karakoram, the Pamir, and the Hindu Kush Ranges. \r\n</p><p>Moderate sized earthquakes are fairly common in this region; the area within 250 km of today&#39;s earthquake has experienced 13 other M6&#43; events over the past 50 years. These include half a dozen M6.0-6.4 earthquakes very close to the January 19, 2020 earthquake; a M 6.3 just to the northwest in March 1996 (24 fatalities, over 15,000 houses destroyed); a M 6.4 to the south in August 1998 (3 fatalities, 3,600 homes destroyed); and a M 6.3 just to the south in February 2003 (260 fatalities, 70,000 collapsed buildings). In August 1902, a M 7.7 earthquake occurred just to the northwest of this event; little is known about the impact of this much larger event, though it is thought to have killed at least 500 and resulted in significant local destruction.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12614:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>A 6.4-magnitude earthquake has killed one person and slightly injured two others in northwest China&#39;s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, authorities said Monday.\r\n</p><p>The tremor toppled four private stores and 1,084 meters of walls, and caused cracks in more than 1,000 houses and 5,574 meters of walls.

Almost all structures in Antioch were damaged, and three quarters of the city collapsed, killing a large number of people, including the consul Pedo Vergilianus. The exact number of deaths is unknown, but it must have been exceedingly high because the emperor Trajan was wintering there with this troops at the time, and his presence had attracted many litigants, embassies and sightseers; in addition, to that, since the earthquake occurred first thing in the morning, many people would still have been indoors. Very few of those in Antioch went unscathed, and the Emperor himself, trapped in the ruins of his residence, made his way out through a window of the room in which he was staying, with slight injuries.

During the years 341 to 343 a series of destructive earthquakes occurred in the Southern coasts of Asia Minor and in the island of Cyprus. These events are mentioned by many chroniclers of the time, who do not agree on the date of the earthquake in Cyprus. A most interesting analysis of these texts was made by Sathas (1873), who proved beyond doubt that the earthquake in Cyprus should have occurred in 342 AD, and that minor seismic activity might have proceeded and followed this earthquake. Allowing for natural exaggerations, there can not have been much of Salamis in Cyprus left standing after this, and the emperor rebuilt it as Constantia (Sathas 1873). Paphos was so badly damaged, that it was not for some time rebuilt. (CL Sathas (1873), Unger-Kotschy (1865) p. 60.) (reference #23)\r\n</p><p>342, throughout the East many cities overturned.

The city of Gyandzha (now Kirovobad) and the church in Akhpat were destroyed. Many people died. The earthquake was accompanied by a thick fog, which covered the mountains and fields. There were major landslides, relief changes, and earth creeps in the Mount Algarak region. A canyon was blocked off by slides, which formed a lake that exists to this day (Gei-Gel). The epicenter of this event is in the Lake Gei-Gel region. The intensity at the epicenter is 9 (landslides, earth creep, and victims), and in Akhpat is 6 (minimal estimate).

This earthquake was felt over all the world. Egypt was also shaken during this year. (reference #1098)\r\n</p><p>1139 A.D.

For instance, the fifteenth -century author Taghri Birdi reports a loss of 230,000 lives in the earthquake, which he claims was worst at Aleppo. In fact these losses were due to the earthquake of 20 September 1139 in Ganjak, in Georgia. (reference #9116)</p>",

The first occurred during the afternoon and\r\nstrongly affected Jerusalem, al-Khalil (Hebron), Ghazza\r\n(Gaza), al-Ramla, al-Karak, al-Salt and Nablus and was\r\nfelt as far as Damascus. It lasted a short while, but\r\ndamaged or fissured most of the tall buildings in Jerusalem\r\nand al-Khalil. The madrasa of Qayitbey in Ghazza was destroyed and likewise southern, northern and eastern\r\nparts of his madrasa in Jerusalem. The top of the minaret at the Chain Gate was destroyed. Nablus was affected more than anywhere else and about 500 people were killed beneath the wreckage there.\r\n<p>The Patriarch of Jerusalem reported the effects of the earthquake on the belfry of the Holy Sepulchre, which fell onto the Church of the Resurrection. The bell-tower of the church in Bethlehem also felt effects on the rivers flowing into the sea near Jaffa are reported in contemporary accounts, as well as the damming of the river Jordan. In addition, the sea withdrew from the coast of south Palestine and returned as a tsunami, which drowned many people.\r\n</p><p>Another shock, stronger than the first, occurred on\r\nthe night of Saturday-Sunday 10 Muharram 953/I3 March 1546 and another on Wednesday morning 12 Rabi&#39; I, 953/29 September 1546, which some people felt more than others. These aftershocks followed a series of tremors over the preceding days and nights.\r\n</p><p>There is no indication that the shock affected Egypt,\r\nalthough this was probably the case, by analogy with the\r\nearthquake of 12 November 1458, with which there are\r\nseveral points in common. Modern writers report effects in Tripoli in Syria and Famagusta in Cyprus, but this appears to be due to damaging storms that year, and an earthquake in Cyprus in 1547. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #3845)\r\n</p><p>January 14, 1546. Several medieval manuscripts describe the earthquake, which is said to have destroyed Ramie, Nablus, possibly also Jaffa, and caused some memorable damage in Jerusalem. From two sources it is learned that &#34;the sea at Jaffa receded a day&#39;s journey, one could walk on the dry bottom, and about 10 thousand people came to pick up things from the sea flow, however the sea returned soon and all drowned. Bernhertz (1616) gave a similar description adding that the &#34;sea bottom remained dry for three days. (reference #2901)\r\n</p><p>1546, in Palestine. The sea retired several miles (?) from the coast, and then returned with great impetuosity. Joppa, Sichem, and Rama were especially injured. The bed of the Jordan remained dry for two days (?).

The source of the earthquake was evidently situated close to Arequipa. The tremors affected an area of 1650 km along the coast and 130 km inland. Numerous landslides, avalanches, subsidences, depressions and ground cracks were observed. Arequipa was almost completely destroyed; only San Francisco Monastery was preserved. During the tremors it was impossible to stand upright. The collapsing buildings generated a thick dust which darkened the sky as if night had arrived, and people almost suffocated as they fled the city in fear. Most of the small rivers disappeared because their source dried up. Canals, which had cost the government a great deal of money, collapsed. The shocks continued for about a quarter of an hour. Also destroyed were Ica, San Marcos de Arica, and all the settlements between 16<sup>o</sup> and 20<sup>o</sup> S. Estimated losses amounted to more than a million gold pesos. These problems were compounded by the appearance of a tsunami which flooded the coastline for a distance of 1200 km. Arica suffered most of all. \r\n<p>1705, November 26 (or 16). An earthquake occurred in Arequipa and Arica, and the wave generated during that quake flooded and destroyed a large part of Arica.

The movement was felt more than 1650 km from north to south and over at least 130 km from the coast into the interior.

Father Diaz relates what happened about a half an hour later when there were terrible vibrations which lasted a long time, cracked the\r\nbeams of buildings, shook down tiles, and loosened stone walls. This first shock was said to have been stronger than that of August 20, 1658, but of shorter duration. The\r\nwooden posts supporting the heavy roofs now proved their value, for in spite of broken walls the houses did not utterly collapse as on former occasions. The greatest damage was suffered in old buildings and in those in bad condition, which has been true of Philippine earthquakes in general.

There occurred most violent earthquakes which produced disasters in the neighboring provinces equal to, if not exceeding those of 1749.

During this time the intensity and aspect of the eruption were continually changing. It was two hundred days of devastation and ruin for the inhabitants, to whom the time must have appeared an eternity. During this terrible time the four principal towns of the laguna of Bombon disappeared, viz, Sala, Lipa, Tanauan, and Taal, with the numerous villages around them...\r\n</p><p>The activity of the volcano continued, with short intervals of quiet, during the months of October and November. On the evening of the feast of All Saints the volcano again began to vomit forth fire, stones, sand, mud, and ashes in a greater quantity than ever. This went on till November 15, on which date, after vespers, there commenced a succession of rumblings, so loud as to deafen one, and the volcano began to vomit forth smoke so dense and black as to darken the atmosphere, and at the same time such a great quantity of large stones fell into the lake as to cause big waves. The earth trembled, the houses shook, and yet this was but the preparation for a fresh rain of scoriae and ashes, which lasted the whole of the afternoon and part of the night.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2070)</p>",

A severe earthquake and tsunami occurred in the area of Copiapo (Chile). \r\n</p><p>On April 11, 1819, at 23:00 [local time] (27 S, 71.5 W, magnitude 8), an exceptionally <b>severe earthquake</b>, which was preceded by a frightening rumbling sound, <b>completely destroyed the city</b>. Strong vibrations lasted about 7 minutes. Only a few houses, mainly wooden houses, survived the shocks, but even they were badly damaged. Even walls of 1 m thickness, supported by solid buttresses, collapsed. Many cracks appeared in the ground, and displacements were recorded along some of them. The suburb of Chimba, which was about 3 km from the center of the city, sustained little damage. The area experienced repeated shocks during the following six months. The earthquake of April 11 caused minor damage to Vallenar.\r\n</p><p>The area in which the earthquake of April 11 had originated, gave rise to a tsunami which was recorded over a distance of 800 km, including in Huasco. At first the ocean receded a little, but it quickly swept back over the land, penetrating in places up to 600 m beyond the high water line. <b>Caldera sustained considerable damage</b>. After the tsunami, the inhabitants went to the shore to dig for copper ingots which had been washed away by the waves.\r\n</p><p>At Concepcion, the rising waves advanced up the River Bio-Bio; on the 12th at 02:00 the anchorlines of the schooner &#34;La Fortuna&#34; were broken by the ebb and flow currents and the schooner ended up being grounded on rocks.\r\n</p><p>On the western shore of the island of Hawaii, nine oscillations of the sea level were noted, starting with an ebb and occurring at intervals of 10-11 minutes. The water level rose up to 2 m, but there were no casualties. In Honolulu the sea level rose and fell 13 times within a few hours.\r\n</p><p>It is possible that the tsunami was also recorded on the island of Mangareva.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)\r\n</p><p>April 11, 1819, 03:00 UTC, 27 S, 71.5 W, magnitude 8.5.

Negus Sahle Sellassie was then forced to relocate his capital on the summit of the escarpment at Debre Berhan (N 09.7&#39;, E 39.6&#39;). The first shocks were reported on 23 and 24 April 1841. On 7 July 1842, two other earthquakes triggered a landslide that blocked the road from Debre Berhan to Ankober.

Damage to the city was heavy; 21% of the homes were completely destroyed, and 31% were seriously damaged. The remaining 944 homes suffered comparatively little, but not one home in the city remained undamaged. The destruction was increased by the fact that the residential district of the city, situated on the alluvial loams of the Copiapo River, was built up mainly with old, dilapidated homes of the pise or wood cottages type with heavy flat roofs (25%), adobe homes with very flimsy  mortar (25%), covered frame houses (25%), and reed panel homes (25%). It was mainly homes of the first and to some extent, of the second type, especially those situated on the weakest soils, which suffered. Numerous cracks up to 100 m long formed in the ground [8 degrees].\r\n<p>Near Copiapo, at Potrero-Seco, moderate damage was done to flimsy houses [6-7]. A collapse occurred near Punta Colorado, blocking the railway [7]. At Pugios, not a single home escaped some damage (it was mainly pise houses which were damaged); small cracks formed in the ground [7]. At San Antonio and Loroz, some homes were destroyed and many were damaged; several irrigation canals were completely destroyed [7-8]. At Tres-Puentes, numerous avalanches blocked the highway [8]. At Vallenar, walls cracked in some buildings [6-7]. A strong earthquake felt at Pueblo Undido and Tierra Amarilla.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake was preceded by two foreshocks and was followed by aftershocks.\r\n</p><p>At Caldera, the earthquake also lasted about 6 minutes. It was difficult to walk. The railway pier suffered damage. The cross was knocked off the church and shop windows were broken. Small cracks opened up in the ground near the beach. There was no other damage to the city, which was built up mainly with wooden homes [6-7].\r\n</p><p>[NOTE: numbers in brackets are intensities].\r\n</p><p>After the earthquake, the sea slowly retreated from shore and the passenger quay dried up completely.

The earthquake caused severe damage in the Osa Peninsula. Most affected were the alluvial plains along the Golfo Dulce and the Bahia de Coronado, where soil liquefaction was the cause of severe damage. \r\n<p>At Golfito the port facilities, the water supply, the electricity system and many buildings of all types of construction were destroyed, and <b>four people were killed</b>. The railway line was also destroyed along a length of about 1 km due to excessive ground deformation, most probably caused by lateral spreading of the ground. Landslides near the port and slumping of the ground near the coast added to the damage. Puerto Jimenes was also ruined and its landing pier and many of its timber houses were destroyed. \r\n</p><p>Palmar Sur, Piedras Blancas, Puerto Cortes, La Angelita and Pozos Sur were almost totally destroyed, and even timber houses collapsed or became uninhabitable, mainly due to the liquefaction and excessive deformation of the ground. \r\n</p><p>Ground movements were very strong; at La Angelita animals staggered and at Puerto Cortes trees were uprooted. The landing pier of Puerto Cortes was put out of commission and in the town the church was damaged beyond repair, the school collapsed and many houses were destroyed. <b>Two people were killed and many were injured</b>.\r\n</p><p>Segments of the railroad track between Golfito and Puerto Cortes, totalling a few kilometres, slumped due to excessive settlement of the ground and they were destroyed. At Santiago, Panama, a number of houses, the municipal building and a school were toppled and at David a few houses were destroyed.\r\n</p><p>The shock caused great panic and minor damage over a large area that extended to Quepos, Parrita, San Pablo and to the densely populated central plateau. The earthquake was strongly felt as far away as Bagaces, Guanacaste, Puntareas and San Isidoro in the northwest and in the Peninsula de Azuero at Pedasi and Panama City in the east. At Balboa Heights the seismograph pendulum clock\r\nstopped. The shock was experienced on board a vessel steaming near 8.58 N, 84.45 W, 160 km from the epicentre. range of 23 cm.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake was recorded on a tide gauge at Puntarenas in Costa Rica. The disturbance began at 21 h 45 m, about one hour after the main shock, and continued for about six hours with an average range of 23 cm.\r\n</p><p>The earthquake was followed by many strong aftershocks that caused additional damage and triggered new slides in the region between Puerto Cortes and Golfito.\r\n</p><p>Both macroseismic and instrumental data confirm a location for this earthquake east of the Gulf of Dulce in Costa Rica.

The main source, a subvertical normal fault with a possible strike-slip component, was located in the boundary zone between the Frontal Ridge of the Western Kopet Dagh and the Kopet Dagh foredeep (the Kazandzhik depression) and was of the same type as the source of the Ashkhabad earthquake of 1948. Both sources are associated with a regional fault extending along the entire Kopet Dagh system, at the boundary between the Frontal anticline range and the Kopet Dagh foredeep, and are due to the tectonic process of the foredeep development. According to the size of the main source (~45 km), the magnitude of the Kazandzhik earthquake was M ~ 6.9-7.0. The smaller source (a reversed-thrust fault with strike-slip components) is associated with one of the active faults in Greater Balkhan structures. (reference #12412)</p>",

The Sorsogon earthquake of July 2 was felt over a wide area of the Philippines and embraced the provinces of Sorsogon, Albay, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Southern Quezon, and the islands of Samar, Leyte, Masbate, Cebu, Boho, Negros and Panay. The maximum intensity was V in Daet. The center of the earthquake, as determined by instrumental data on its aftershocks by seismographs of the Weather Bureau, Commission on Volcanology, and Manila Observatory, has been located at 380 km southeast of Manila and in the immediate vicinity of the towns of Sorsogon and Bacon. The official report of casualties obtainable at Sorsogon shows that a total of thirteen were killed either by falling debris or were pinned under heavy household furniture. Of the thirteen deaths, eight were in Sorsogon town, four in Bacon, and one in Legaspi city when a laborer fell from a scaffolding he was working on. A total of 101 injured persons were treated at the Sorsogon Provicial Hospital, seven of which were serious cases. Four of the more serious were brought to Manila for needed medical attention. The damage to buildings was essentially limited to old and poorly built structures of bricks and cobbles cemented only by lime mortar. The belfries of the churches at Sorsogon and Bacon collapsed while the rest of the churches remained relatively intact. Other old buildings were only slightly fractured. Water mains in the town of Sorsogon were broken and several electric lines were disconnected. Damage to roads were relatively insignificant. Some minor fissures were noted at Bacon but they were small and hardly affected the utility of the roads. An old Spanish bridge at the provincial road between Bacon and Sorsogon was fractured at the middle and may have to be reconstructed to allow heavier traffic.

This vast range,\r\n1,500 km long, is composed of a series of structural\r\naxes; the epicentre was located in the Bogdo Mountains.\r\nThis is a sparsely populated region. Several wintering\r\nplaces were totally destroyed, particularly Dzun\r\nBogd, Bayan-leg and Barum Bogd.

It is characterized by extensive fault scarps, subsidence and uplift, a massive landslide, and a seiche in Hebgen Lake. A maximum MM intensity X was assigned to the fault scarps in the epicentral area. The instrumental epicenter lies within the region of surface faulting. The most spectacular and disastrous effect of the earthquke was the huge avalanche of rock, soil, and trees that cascaded from the steep south wall of the Madison River canyon. This slide formed a barrier that blocked the gorge and stoped the flow of the Madison River and within a few weeks, created a lake almost 53 m deep. The volume of material that blocked the Madison River below Hebgen Dam has been estimated at 28-33 million m<sup>3</sup>. Most of the 28 deaths were caused by rockslides that covered the Rock Creek public campground on the Madison River, about 9.5 km below Hebgen Dam. \r\n</p><p>New fault scarps as high as 6 m formed near Hebgen Lake. The major fault scarps formed along pre-existing normal faults northeast of Hebgen Lake. Subsidence ocurred over much of an area that was about 24 km north-south and about twice as long east-west. As a result of the faulting near Hebgen Lake, the bedrock beneath the lake was permanently warped, causing the lake floor to drop and generate a seiche. Maximum subsidence was 6.7 m in Hebgen Lake Basin. About 130 km<sup>2</sup> subsided more than 3 m, and about 500 km<sup>2</sup> subsided more than 0.3 m. The earth-fill dam sustained significant cracks in its concrete core and spillway, but it continued to be an effective structure.\r\n</p><p>Many summer houses in the Hebgen Lake area were damaged: houses and cabins shifted off their foundations, chimneys fell, and pipeines broke. Most small-unit masonry structures and wooden buildings along the major fault scarps survived with little damage when subjected only to vibratory forces. Roadways were cracked and shifted extensively, and much timber was destroyed. Highway damage near Hebgen Lake was due to landslides slumping vertically and flowing laterally beneath pavements and bridges, which caused severe cracks and destruction. Three of the five reinforced bridges in the epicentral area also sustained significant damage. \r\n</p><p>High intensities were observed in the northwest section of Yellowstone National Park. Here, new geysers erupted and massive slumping caused large cracks in the ground from which steam emitted. Many hot springs became muddy. \r\n<br />(above from reference #542)\r\n</p><p> Reference #1250 lists $26 million dollars damage.</p>",

According to the press agency Belga, 24 persons were reported killed; at Uvira (Congo) all the houses were damaged and the Catholic and Protestant churches evacuated; in the port of Kalundi, a new pier sank 30 cm; landslides occurred in the mountains west of Lake Tanganyika (press\r\nreports). Damage was also reported at Bukavu, the capital of the province of Kivu (Congo), where the post office collapsed (Seismological Notes, Bull. Seismol. Soc. Amer., 1960). The main shock was preceded by a premonitory one at 05:38 h and followed by an aftershock at 09:15 h. Damage at Kasulu (Tanzania), 150 km from the epicentre. (reference #1040)",

        "comments": "<p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #414:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>1964, June 16, 13:02 local time. There was a very strong earthquake and a moderate tsunami with source on the shelf of the Sea of Japan (several tens of kilometers to the north-northeast of Niigata) in the form of an ellipse measuring 90 x 35 km, extending along Honshu Island. The length of the zone of perceptibility was 1000 km.</p><p>The total losses from the earthquake and tsunami (separate figures for each phenomenon are not available) have been estimated at 80 million dollars; <b>26 people died and about 450 were injured</b>; about 86,400 people suffered material losses.</p><p>The bulk of the damage occurred at Niigata. The seismic tremors themselves did slight damage to the city, except that a fire lasting two weeks broke out in the region of the oil tanks.</p><p>However, as the result of the seismic shocks there was an almost instantaneous compaction, with fractures, of the loose delta deposits of the Shinano and Agano Rivers, on which a large part of the city is located. An abrupt increase in the pressure of ground waters at a depth of about 1 m, caused the appearance of numerous mud volcanoes, which ejected a mixture of sand and water. This, together with other circumstances, led to the flooding of the soil. The upper loose layer liquesced. Multi-story buildings made of prestressed concrete and other tall structures with weak foundations inclined 5-15<sup>o</sup> from the vertical, and some lay completely on the ground. Heavy buildings sank into the ground. The ends of long buildings shifted 1-2 m relative to each other.</p><p>The cause of the earthquake was the upward dislocation along tectonic fractures of a system of interlocked Neogene - Quaternary anticlinals, including the small rocky Ava Island, and the simultaneous settling of the narrow underwater depression, separating the above mentioned system from Honshu Island. Thus the dislocations in the earthquake corresponded to the general direction of the most recent tectonic movements in its focal zone. Quantitatively, these dislocations characterized by the following figures. Ava Island rose 1-1.5 m and tilted 1 deg to the northwest. The maximum elevation occurred on the floor of the sea 15 km south of Ava Island and was 5-6 m. The maximal local subsidence, near Honshu Island, was estimated at 3-4 m. In area, the zone of subsidences was approximately one tenth the area of elevations. These measurements of the floor tie in well with the results of the determination of the mechanism of the source of the earthquake on the basis of instrumental seismic data. The coast of Honshu Island adjoining the zone of subsidences subsided 10-20 cm. According to the tide gauge data, the slow tectonic movements in the focal zone in the four years\r\nbefore the earthquake were directed oppositely to the dislocations, but before and after this period, they had the same direction. On the basis of geomorphological observations, Japanese specialists surmise that about\r\n800 years was required to prepare for the earthquake [this may be exaggerated]. The tsunami was maximal on the coast of Honshu Island closes to its source.\r\n</p><p>Iida et al.

Preceded and followed by many strong shocks, an earthquake with an epicentre offshore, in the Gulf of Suez, affected the area of the islands of Shadwan, Tawila and Gubal. At Shadwan the shock caused\r\nnumerous rockfalls and it was strong enough to throw people to the ground but because of the desolate nature of the region there was no damage to property. The Shaker lighthouse at the south end of the island suffered mortar cracks near its base and mercury in a container at the top of the tower spilled out. A zone of ground deformation, probably of non-tectonic origin, was noticed extending in a north-south direction for about 1 km showing a few centimetres of right-lateral displacement. About 10 km west of this zone, in the sea, a coral reef was raised permanently above sea-level. Dead fish and some agitation of the sea were noticed after the main shock.\r\nAt Hurghada the shock caused some damage, including\r\ncracks in the brick walls of a reinforced concrete\r\npower plant, and plaster cracks in two hotels. Similar\r\neffects were reported from Gemsa, At Tor a few dilapidated\r\nadobe houses were damaged, and at the monastery\r\nof St Catherine&#39;s plaster in a building cracked and\r\npartly fel! from a ceiling. At Sharm al-Shaikh the earthquake produced cracks along mortar joints in walls,\r\narticles fell from shelves and furniture was displaced.\r\nPeople ran outdoors and had difficulty standing. Light\r\nwooden houses remained intact, and overall damage to\r\nproperty was negligible. Rockfalls and talus slides triggered by the shock raised clouds of dust. There is no\r\nevidence that the shock had any adverse effect on the\r\nBalaim and other oilfields on the western and eastern\r\nsides of the Gulf of Suez. Outside the epicentral region damage was sporadic, the shock affecting primarily a few vulnerable structures, and otherwise negligible.

The earthquake was felt strongest on these and neighboring islands. The shock was also felt in Papua, New Guinea. Deep inland on New Britain, the earthquake was felt at an intensity of 8-9 points (MM). In Rabaul the intensity was 7-8 points (MM). Damage was not significant in the city but was heavy in the region where intensity reached 8 pints. In Wide Bay and Wakkunai an intensity of 5 points was recorded and in Kieta the intensity was 5-6 points. In Kobuassan the stylus of the seismograph broke. Precise data are not available for New Ireland and Bougainville. In some regions the earthquake intensity was apparently not less than 8-9 points (M).\r\n<p>The earthquake caused <b>two deaths, five serious injuries, and considerable damage</b>; coastal highways were blocked by landslides and hydro-electric plants\r\nwere destroyed. Bii and Hives, two small islands in the Rabaul Gulf, were partially submerged. The tsunami which followed this earthquake reached the harbor of Rabaul approximately 30 min after the earthquake.

Also felt at Allahabad, Delhi, Nagpur and in parts of western Orissa. (reference #1053)\r\n<p>A small to medium intensity earthquake rocked central India on May 22, 1997, killing about 56 people and injuring over 1000. The earthquake measuring 6.0 on Richter scale struck at 4:22 a.m. near Jabalpur, a city in the state of Madhya Pradesh about 640 km southeast of New Delhi. The city of Jabalpur is inhabited by nearly 1 million people. The quake&#39;s epicenter was in nearby Kosamghat village (25 km southeast of Jabalpur), where nearly 200 mud houses were flattened, leaving more than 1,000 residents homeless. The Narmada valley area in Jabalpur district was the worst affected. Adjacent districts like Manlia, Seoni, Narsinghpur, Chhindwara, Sagar, Satna, Durg, Ujjain, Bunde1khand, Rewa and Bhopal were also affected. Water and electric supply were disrupted and the rail network was also affected. According to the district administration the loss to property was estimated at Rs. 500 crores (US$ 143 million). Preliminary estimates state that 12,759 houses suffered heavy damage. Nearly 13,000 households lost their homes. The loss appeared to be greater in rural areas, where 107 villages were badly hit. (reference #1271)\r\n</p><p>The earthquake occurred on May 22, 1997 at 04:22 am (local time) centered about 8 km southeast of the city of Jabalpur (epicenter 23.18 N 80.02 E) in the state of Madhya Pradesh in central India. USGS estimates the depth of focus at a default 33 km. It caused significant damage to structures in the districts of Jabalpur, Mandla, Sivni and Chhindwada in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The maximum damage was in the districts of Jabalpur and Mandla. About 8546 houses collapsed and about 52,690 houses were badly damaged. In all, 887 villages (or equivalent) were affected. More than 90% of houses collapsed or were badly damaged in at least two of these villages with a population of about 500. During this earthquake, about 38 persons died and about 350 were injured. The maximum intensity of shaking experienced during the earthquake was VIII on the MSK scale at the villages of Kosamghat and Kudaria. However, the intensity of shaking showed significant variation from location to location. For example, some areas of Jabalpur town had intensities of VII while in other areas it was as low as V. (reference #1262)\r\n</p><p>On 22 May (21 May at 21:55:31 UTC) 1997, a moderate\r\nsize destructive earthquake of Mw 5.8, with a focal depth\r\nof 35 km (constrained by two depth phases pPPnp and\r\nsPPnp) occurred along the south Narmada fault near the\r\nJabalpur city of central India. This southerly-dipping\r\nsouth Narmada fault had also experienced the 1927 Son\r\nValley earthquake of Mw 6.4 whose return period was estimated to be 35 <u>&#43;</u> 5 years. Nevertheless, the mean interval between moderate earthquakes in the Narmada-Son lineament (NSL) is estimated to be 16 <u>&#43;</u> 6 years. A study of depth phases (pPPnp and sPPnp) and the moment-tensor inversion of filtered (20-50 s) broadband data of IMD seismic stations for the Jabalpur main shock suggest a focal depth of 35 km and a thrust fault with a strike 61 deg, dip 64 deg and rake 74 deg. The ENE trending NSL, about 100 km wide, runs across peninsular India for a length of about 2000 km. (reference #1266)</p>",

At least 74 people killed, including 26 killed by a tsunami; 2,689 injured; 17,584 homes destroyed (VIII) and 35,601 homes damaged in the Arequipa-Camana-Tacna area. An additional 64 people missing due to the tsunami in the Camana-Chala area. Landslides blocked highways in the epicentral area. Many of the historic buildings at Arequipa were damaged or destroyed.

Demographic information on earthquake victims compiled by the Instituto Nacional de Defensa Civil suggests that most of the victims of ground-shaking damage were the young or the elderly. However, about a third of the tsunami victims were between 30 and 50. No demographic information was available for the 52 persons listed as missing, but anecdotal evidence gathered by the reconnaissance team indicated that most were farmers working in the onion fields.

Evidence provided by Thucidides indicates that a series of earthquakes occurred in the regions of Attica, Boeotia, Euboea in the autumn of 427 B.C. during the fifth year of the Petoponnesian war, which caused the Spartans, who interpreted underground shocks as a bad omen, to abandon attempts to conquest Attica although their forces had already reached the Isthmus of Corinth. Especially strong shocks occurred in Orchomenos. Earthquakes continued till the summer of 426 B.C. The shocks weakened by summer and autumn to an extent that the Spartans renewed their military operations, even in the focal zone of the earthquakes (in the region of Heraclea). Several shocks in the summer and autumn of 426 B.C. occurred in the strait separating the Euboea Island from the continent. <p>The cities of Phalara (Stylis), Lamia, Larisa were completely destroyed as a result of a sole earthquake or a series of earthquakes. Terrible destruction took place in Heraclea. Skarfia, where <b>2,500 people were killed</b>, suffered the same fate. The cities of Nope, Heraclea, Cynos, Opus, Echinos suffered serious damage. The fortress of Ohm towering above Opus was broken down. The wall of the city of Elatia came down in parts. In Alponous, towers and walls in the harbour crashed, dragging many inhabitants down with them into the water. The walls and 700 houses nearest to the coast tumbled down in Oreon on Euboea Island. The Orobies settlement (Rovies today) was also destroyed. Atalanti, Peparithos and Skopelos suffered damage, the walls of the city assembly hall and some houses were partly destroyed there. </p><p>As a result of the earthquake, the outflow of hot springs was interrupted at Aedepsos and Thermopyles for three days; they started flowing again later, but one of them in Aedepsos started gushing at a new place. Springs and rivers dried up everywhere for several days. The River Spercheios began to flow along a new course.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2130)\r\n</p><p>426 B.C. October, Maliac Gulf. A destructive earthquake in central Greece. According to Thucydides and Demosthenes it occurred during the celebration of the Thesmophotia (October/November) in the Athenian calendar), in the sixth year of the Peloponesian War (426 BC). Much of the destruction caused by the earthquake and the associated seismic sea wave occurred on both sides of the coasts of the Euboean, Maliac and Oreus Gulfs... Scarphea was flung up, foundations and all, with the <b>loss of not less than 1700 men</b>. At Thronium <b>850 people were killed</b> and at Alponus the tower fell into the sea killing all in it. (reference #9116)\r\n</p><p>According to Demetrious of Gallatis (Strabo, liber i, cf. 3.20), much of the Lichades islands (Lichadonesia) and the promontory of Cenaeun (Kinaion) in northwestern Euboea were engulfed. A land strip that used to form a peninsula off the Greek mainland was tom through to form the Atalanta island (Talantonisi) (Diodoros, liber xii, cf. 58). In Euboea, the territory of Orobiae (Rovies) subsided and the shoreline advanced inland after the earthquake (Thucydides, liber iii, cf.89.2) (reference #544)\r\n</p><p>The intensity of the earthquake has been estimated as intensity XI (MSK scale) comparable to magnitudes between 6.9 (Papadopoulos et al. 2014) and 7.5 (Ambraseys 1997, Waldherr 1997).

At Ambon, the Chinese district was completely flattened. All the stone houses and the church cracked so much that they became unusable. Seventy-nine Chinese and seven Europeans died under the debris of the buildings; 35 people were injured (fractures of the arms and legs). Seven homes collapsed compeltely at Nako.

The Middleburg redoubt collapsed.</p><p>On the Leitimor and Hitu Peninsulas, the ground cracked at many places and there were numerous avalanches, which were especially strong in the Wawani and Manuzau Mountains. Some streams, especially on the western shore, were blocked. The ground water level oscillated with an amplitude of up to 1-2 m. The water rose up so quickly from deep wells that it could be scooped up in the hands, and then fell back just as quickly.

A 3.5-meter tsunami was measured at Unumatana and a 2 meter tsunami was observed at Kelau, Woodlark Island, Papua New Guinea, where 17 houses were destroyed, a church was damaged and the tsunami ran inland up to 1 km. The tsunami also caused damage on Rossel Island and Bougainville.

Uplift was measured on uplifted\r\ncorals based on high tide water lines, while subsidence was\r\ndetermined based on boat docks, disappeared navigation\r\nobstacles and engulfed trees. The southern part of Ranongga\r\nIsland was uplifted by up to 3.6 m decreasing towards the\r\nnorth with only 1.5 m uplift (Figure 3d). Less than 1 m\r\nuplift was determined on the northwest tip of Vella Lavella\r\nand Vonavona Islands. The islands were uplifted during the\r\nearthquake prior to tsunami arrival significantly reducing\r\nthe tsunami impact.

        "comments": "<p>1791, Nov 2. Zakynthos. A locally destructive earthquake occurred in Zante. The earthquake was preceded by shocks, which continued intermittently for almost 10 days. In Zante the shock affected mainly the southeastern part of the island where, within a radius of about 8 km from the town, the shock caused heavy damage, particularly to settlements and villages situated on high ground in the alluvial plain: the six villages were totally destroyed. In the western part of the island damage was negligible. The sources of bitumen were activated by the shock...\r\n</p><p>Along the coast near the town, the ground opened up and in places settled.\r\n</p><p>In the town [Zante] 22 people were killed and about 70 were injured. The earthquake caused equally heavy damage to the part of the Peloponnese facing Zante. Gastuni was razed to the ground, with only three houses left standing. In all about <b>50 people were killed and 80 injured</b>.\r\n</p><p>Aftershocks continued daily, for six weeks. These on 25 and 30 Oct (O.S.) were felt more strongly at sea than on land.\r\n</p><p>Contrary to contemporary press reports, there is no evidence that the shock caused damage in Patra and Aigio, or that it was felt in Corfu, Sicily or Italy...\r\n</p><p>The ground opened up on the coastal plains of Zakynthos as well as of the Morea (Peloponnese), destroying most of the houses, particularly in Gustani (Gastouni). The earthquake may have affected Kefalonia.\r\n</p><p>There were mild aftershocks for about six weeks, some of which caused damage. The strongest was that of 5-6/10 November (q.v.). During that time many of the inhabitants stayed outside in the open, taking part in religious processions. Heavy rains caused subsidence, and 40 years after the earthquake large ravines were seen in the hill on which the town of Zante was built.\r\n</p><p>The final casualty estimates were about 80 killed and more injured, which includes those who died of shock or became ill from exposure...\r\n</p><p>Incidentally, there is confusion in the sources regarding the spelling of two place names, namely Gastroni, Gufiun or Gatuni for modern Gastouni on the Peloponnese, and Gureadi or Gaetani for Ghaitani, a site located below the fortress of Zante.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #9116)\r\n</p><p>1791, Nov 2, 1791. Greece, Island of Zante; shocks continued six weeks. Intensity III which corresponds to an earthquake which destroyed towns and devastated districts. (reference #1055)\r\n</p><p>1791, Nov 2. 37.8 N, 21.0 E, magnitude 6.8, intensity X (Zante, Gaitani). This was known to the inhabitants of the island as the earthquake of Aghios Iakovos, because it occurred in the day of feast of this Saint. Barbiani D.G. himself, who described the effects of the earthquake, was found under the ruins of his family house. All west part of the island suffered no damage but all houses in the eastern hills and particularly the fortress were pulled down up to the foundations. Six villages which were in the foot of these mountains were almost entirely overturned. The village Gaitani, which is under the fortress, became a pile of stones and ruins. The mainshock caused very important damage also in Gastoune and felt up to Calavria, Apoulia, Sicily and in Napoli. The aftershocks continued for more than 6 weeks and the stronger of them occurred in the 8th day with a terrible sound from the sea. Those in the caiques thought that everything was destroyed but on land the shock was not so violent. Before the earthquake optic phenomena were observed and exceptional warmth occurred (Barbiani and Barbiani, 1864; Chiotes, 1886-87).

All but ten of the thirteen villages on Fayal Island were damaged. One village of 1,200 population had only twenty houses standing. On September 2nd the civil governor reported that the known deaths at that time were nine and the number of wounded about 200. The main shock was followed by many aftershocks of lesser intensity.\r\n</p><p>On August 31, 1926, Faial Island was struck by an earthquake of Ms 5.6 and MMI X, and the epicentre was located in the channel between Faial and Pico Islands.

(reference #1919)\r\n</p><p>Concerning the event in 1926, Agostinho (1927) described a &#34;, .. damaging earthquake on Fayal and Pico islands .... The people aboard the ships in the harbor [Horta--Faial Island] felt violently the earthquake, but only small waves nearly two feet high were formed which vanished in a two minutes. No tsunami was remarked in any other of the islands&#34;. This account suggests that the violence of the seismic shock had no direct correspondence in tsunami development. (reference #5046)\r\n</p><p>On the morning of the 31st. August 1926 the inhabitants of some of the Azores islands were frightened by a su1den motion of the soil which was most violent on the islands of Faial and Pico where with in five or six seconds the shock caused much damage, a few hundred buildings having been ruined in Horta and suburbs, minor destructions occurring in some distant places of Pico.

Recorded (6U JMA) in Miyagi.\r\n</p><p>B<b>Tectonic Summary</b>\r\n</p><p>The April 7, 2011 earthquake near the east coast of Honshu, Japan occurred as a result of thrust/reverse faulting on or near the subduction zone plate boundary between the Pacific and North America plates. At the latitude of this earthquake, the Pacific plate moves approximately westwards with respect to the North America plate at a rate of 83 mm/yr, and begins its westward descent beneath Japan at the Japan Trench. Note that some authors divide this region into several microplates that together define the relative motions between the larger Pacific, North America and Eurasia plates; these include the Okhotsk and Amur microplates that are respectively part of North America and Eurasia.\r\n\r\nThe epicenter and focal-depth of the April 7 earthquake are consistent with the event having occurred very close to the main interface thrust-fault of the subduction zone plate boundary. Preliminary focal-mechanisms, however, imply slip on a fault with steeper dip than that of the main interface thrust-fault, which may imply an intraplate source is more likely.\r\n</p><p>This earthquake can be considered an aftershock of the March 11, 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. The aftershock sequence of that event has been ongoing since March 11, and has included 58 earthquakes of M 6 or greater up until April 7 2011, two of which were greater than M 7 (M7.7 and M7.9, both on March 11). Over the two days preceding the March 11 earthquake, a series of large foreshocks had occurred, beginning on March 9th with a M 7.2 event approximately 40 km from the epicenter of the March 11 earthquake, and continuing with another three earthquakes greater than M 6 on the same day. Prior to March 9 2011, the Japan Trench subduction zone had hosted nine events of magnitude 7 or greater since 1973. See the tectonic summary of the March 11 event for more details of the historic seismicity in this region.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>Three killed, 93 injured in Japan&#39;s 7.1 aftershock, Herald Sun, April 8, 2011.--A Powerful aftershock rocked Japan&#39;s tsunami disaster zone, killing at least three and triggering new concerns over nuclear power plants in a region still grappling with an atomic emergency. Electricity was cut across a huge area of northern Japan, forcing cooling systems at three nuclear plants to switch to emergency power and plunging more than 3.3 million households into darkness late yesterday night. At least one back-up supply remained online at all three plants, but the aftershock highlighted the potential risks of nuclear generation in an earthquake zone amid a battle to stabilise reactors at tsunami-hit Fukushima. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said a 63-year-old woman in Yamagata prefecture died after her home respirator failed when the power was knocked out. The agency said one person also died in Miyagi prefecture - the area worst hit by the 9.0 magnitude quake of March 11 and the towering tsunami it spawned. It said at least 93 people were confirmed injured as of Friday morning. Jiji Press put the number at around 130. (reference #9336)</p>",

All were centered in the same area about 30 miles southeast of the capital, Guatemala City. Firefighters confirmed that the temblors, which shook most of the country, caused a landslide on the highway to El Salvador near the epicenter of Cuilapa Santa Rosa that trapped at least one car and killed one person.

At the latitude of this earthquake, the Cocos plate moves north-northeast with respect to the Caribbean and North America plates at a velocity of approximately 70-80 mm/yr, and subducts beneath Central America at the Middle America Trench.\r\n</p><p>Over the past 40 years, the region within 250 km of the November 7 earthquake has experienced 50 earthquakes with M 6 or greater; two of these were larger than M 7. The first was a M 7.1 in December of 1983, in approximately the same location as the November 7 event, and resulted in no documented fatalities. The second had a magnitude of M 7.2, and struck a region just over 100 km to the northwest offshore Mexico in September 1993. There was one known fatality associated with the 1993 event. A M6.8 earthquake in October of 1979, 120 km to the east-southeast of the November 7 earthquake, resulted in 7 fatalities in Guatemala.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>San Marcos, Guatemala -  At least 52 are dead and dozens are missing in Guatemala Thursday, as residents huddled in the dark and frigid streets in fear of aftershocks.\r\nOthers crowded inside its hospital, the only building left with electricity after the powerful earthquake.\r\nPresident Otto Perez Molina said the powerful 7.4-magnitude quake that hit Wednesday morning off the Pacific coast affected as many as 1.2 million people as it shook nearly the entire country. He said a little more than 700 people were in shelters, with most opting to stay with family or friends... The quake caused terror over an unusually wide area, with damage reported in all but one of Guatemala&#39;s 22 states and shaking felt as far away as Mexico City, 600 miles to the northwest. It hit hardest in San Marcos, where more than 30 homes collapsed and many of the colorful adobe buildings in its center were either cracked or reduced to rubble, including the police station and the courthouse. The temblor tore a large gash in one of the streets. Hundreds of frightened townspeople stayed in the open, refusing to go back inside after more than five strong aftershocks shook the area. (reference #9985)\r\n</p><p>Authorities in Guatemala have lowered the death toll from last week&#39;s 7.4-magnitude earthquake to 42 from 52, after some people who had been reported dead were found alive. The head of the Central American country&#39;s disaster agency says some people in outlying regions were believed to have died Wednesday in their collapsed homes, but they were later found alive elsewhere. David de Leon says the government&#39;s final estimate on the quake&#39;s impact indicates that 10,330 homes were damaged. Of those, 2,769 will have to be totally or partially demolished.

A preliminary source location suggest the event likely occurred on the Longmenshan fault or a tectonically related fault at a depth of 12km. The Longmenshan fault was the source fault of the May 12, 2008 Mw7.9 Sichuan earthquake. The preliminary April 20 event location is approximately 85km from the hypocentral location of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The April 20 earthquake reflects tectonic stresses resulting from the convergence of crustal material slowly moving from the high Tibetan Plateau, to the west, against strong crust underlying the Sichuan Basin and southeastern China.\r\n</p><p>On a continental scale, the seismicity of central and eastern Asia is a result of northward convergence of the India plate against the Eurasia plate with a velocity of about 50 mm/y. The convergence of the two plates is broadly accommodated by the uplift of the Asian highlands and by the motion of crustal material to the east away from the uplifted Tibetan Plateau.\r\n</p><p>Four events of Mw6.0 or greater have occurred within 200km of the April 19 event in the past 40 years, including the May 2008 Sichuan earthquake and a subsequent aftershock. The northwestern margin of the Sichuan Basin has previously experienced destructive earthquakes.

As with the September 24 event, the September 28 earthquake mechanism and location are consistent with rupture within the Eurasia plate above the Makran subduction zone. The event occurred within the transition zone between northward subduction of the Arabia plate beneath the Eurasia plate and northward collision of the India plate with the Eurasia plate. \r\nOn a broad scale, the tectonics of southern and central Pakistan reflect a complex plate boundary where the India plate slides northward relative to the Eurasia plate in the east, and the Arabia plate subducts northward beneath the Eurasia plate in the Makran (western Pakistan). These motions typically result in north-south to northeast-southwest strike-slip motion at the latitude of the September 24 and 28 earthquakes.

Geologic development of the region is a consequence of a number of first-order plate tectonic processes that include subduction, large-scale transform faulting, compressional mountain building and crustal extension...\r\n</p><p>Off the south coast of Pakistan and southeast coast of Iran, the Makran trench is the present-day surface expression of active subduction of the Arabia plate beneath the continental Eurasia plate, which converge at a rate of approximately 20 mm/yr. Although the Makran subduction zone has a relatively slow convergence rate, it has produced large devastating earthquakes and tsunamis. For example, the November 27, 1945 M8.0 mega-thrust earthquake produced a tsunami within the Gulf of Oman and Arabia Sea, killing over 4,000 people. Northwest of this active subduction zone, collision of the Arabia and Eurasia plates forms the approximately 1,500-km-long fold and thrust belt of the Zagros Mountains, which crosses the whole of western Iran and extends into northeastern Iraq. Collision of the Arabia and Eurasia plates also causes crustal shortening in the Alborz Mountains and Kopet Dag in northern Iran. Eastern Iran experiences destructive earthquakes that originate on both strike-slip and reverse faults. For example, the 16 September 1978 M7.8 earthquake, along the southwest edge of the Dasht-e-Lut Basin killed at least 15,000 people...\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)  \r\n</p><p>State TV says a magnitude 5.5 earthquake has killed one person and injured 30 in a small town in southern Iran.\r\nIt says the quake struck early Thursday morning in the town of Bastak, about 1,200 kilometres south of the capital, Tehran.

Felt widely in southern Mexico.\r\n<p><b>Tectonic Summary</b>\r\n</p><p>\r\nSeismotectonics of Mexico\r\n</p><p>\r\nLocated atop three of the large tectonic plates, Mexico is one of the world&#39;s most seismically active regions. The relative motion of these crustal plates causes frequent earthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. Most of the Mexican landmass is on the westward moving North American plate. The Pacific Ocean floor south of Mexico is being carried northeastward by the underlying Cocos plate. Because oceanic crust is relatively dense, when the Pacific Ocean floor encounters the lighter continental crust of the Mexican landmass, the ocean floor is subducted beneath the North American plate creating the deep Middle American trench along Mexico&#39;s southern coast. Also as a result of this convergence, the westward moving Mexico landmass is slowed and crumpled creating the mountain ranges of southern Mexico and earthquakes near Mexico&#39;s southern coast. As the oceanic crust is pulled downward, it melts; the molten material is then forced upward through weaknesses in the overlying continental crust. This process has created a region of volcanoes across south-central Mexico known as the Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>OAXACA - A 6.3-magnitude earthquake rattled Mexico on Tuesday, killing an elderly woman who fell as she fled her home and injuring another woman who evacuated from a hospital.\r\nThe epicenter was in the east coast state of Veracruz, where residents and tourists fled homes and hotels.\r\nAuthorities found no damage after reviewing the Laguna Verde nuclear power plant and oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico coast. &#34;Only minor damage was reported in buildings&#34; after a nationwide review of infrastructure, national civil protection coordinator Luis Felipe Puente told the Televisa network. But the earthquake claimed one life in the southern state of Oaxaca. A 75-year-old woman died after she fell and knocked her head on the floor when she was fleeing her home in the city of Oaxaca, said civil protection director Felipe Reyna Romero. Another woman broke her arm after falling while carrying a child as she fled a hospital in Oaxaca, Reyna Romero said. Walls and ceilings crumbled in the Oaxaca state cities of Tuxtepec and Loma Bonita, near the epicenter of the quake. Some hotels were evacuated in the city of Oaxaca, the state&#39;s namesake. An explosion was reported in a mine further south in San Jose del Progreso but workers were safely evacuated, Reyna Romero said. (reference #11040)</p>",

The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 6.2 and had its epicenter in the Mediterranean Sea about 77 kilometers (48miles) northwest of Melilla, a small Spanish city surrounded by Morocco and the sea. Spain&#39;s National Geographical Institute said the quake struck at 5:22 a.m. (0422 GMT) and had nearly a dozen aftershocks, including two measuring 4.6 about three hours later. Melilla government president Juan Jose Imbroda said 15 people were treated for minor injuries, mostly bruises and cuts. He put the low number of injuries down to the fact that the quake took place before dawn and most people were indoors. Morocco&#39;s state news service said local authorities in Nador and Al Hoceima reported no damage nor injuries. Spanish National Television images showed chunks of concrete on the ground that fell from apartment buildings in Melilla and residents who ran outside in their pajamas following the quake. The quake was felt as far away as the cities of Cadiz and Malaga across the Mediterranean Sea in mainland Spain. Imbroda said the city government building was probably the building most damaged and would remain closed for three days. He canceled school classes for children until firefighter inspectors could check the school buildings. He said it was not immediately known how many buildings were damaged. The city government urged people to use cars as little as possible so as not to cause any traffic jams. Melilla has a population of some 85,000.

        "comments": "The Sept. 8th, 2017, M 8.1 earthquake offshore Chiapas, Mexico, occurred as the result of normal faulting at an intermediate depth. Focal mechanism solutions for the earthquake indicate slip occurred on either a fault dipping very shallowly towards the southwest, or on steeply dipping fault striking NW-SE. At the location of this event, the Cocos plate converges with North America at a rate of approximately 76 mm/yr, in a northeast direction. The Cocos plate begins its subduction beneath Central America at the Middle America Trench, just over 100 km to the southwest of this earthquake. The location, depth, and normal-faulting mechanism of this earthquake indicate that it is likely an intraplate event, within the subducting Cocos slab, rather than on the shallower megathrust plate boundary interface. At least 78 people killed and 250 injured in Oaxaca; 16 killed in Chiapas; 4 killed in Tabasco. Thousands of houses and hundreds of schools damaged or destroyed and water service disrupted in Chiapas and Oaxaca. Extensive damage at Juchitan. Some damage in Veracruz.

Preliminary focal mechanism solutions for the event indicate rupture occurred on a fault dipping shallowly to the east-northeast, or on a fault dipping steeply to the southwest. At the location of this earthquake, the Arabia plate is moving towards the north with respect to Eurasia at a rate of about 26 mm/yr. The two plates converge along a northwest-striking plate boundary in the general vicinity of this earthquake, driving the uplift of the Zagros mountains in Iran. The location of the event and the shallow, northeast-dipping plane of the focal mechanism solution are consistent with rupture of a plate boundary related structure in this region. </p><p>Over the preceding century, the region within 250 km of the hypocenter of the Nov. 12, 2017 earthquake has experienced 4 other M6&#43; earthquakes. The most recent of these was a M 6.1 earthquake about 100 km to the south of the November 2017 event in January 1967. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a cluster of M 6.0-6.7 earthquakes occurred along the plate boundary about 200 km to the southeast of today&#39;s earthquake. In November 2013, a pair of M 5.6 and M 5.8 earthquakes occurred about 60 km south of the November 2017 event. They are not known to have caused significant damage or fatalities. A M 7.4 earthquake in June 1990, 400 km to the northeast of the Nov. 12, 2017 event, caused between 40,000-50,000 fatalities, more than 60,000 injuries, and left more than 600,000 homeless in the in the Rasht-Qazvin-Zanjan area of Iran.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #11940:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>more than 30,000 houses were affected by the quake - 15,500 of them completely destroyed. </p><p>The official IRNA news agency said 530 were killed while state TV put the number at 432.

Evidence of an earthquake was found by archeological\r\nexcavations in the village of Ak-Tepe, 18 km northeast of Ashkhabad. In 1931, an expedition of the Turkmen branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR uncovered the remains of a collapsed and burned building. According to the reports [Gr]: ... The structure, made from brick. represents a system of small ... rooms, covered ... by a flat roof. It appears that the people abandoned the building rapidly and unexpectedly: the remains of an untouched dinner -- a leg of kulan on an alabaster dish and a serving clay vessel -- were found near the entrance to one of the rooms. Not far from the exit of one of the rooms we found the skeleton of a man, trapped by the collapsed building. The rooms were full of household utensils. There were no signs of pillaging. In one of the rooms, several large clay vessels that had fallen were exhumed; they had once served for holding water. They were all leaning to the\r\nwest. There were traces of a fire--evidently, the roof had collapsed onto burning areas in several of the rooms.&#34; We have not yet located any references to this earthquake in literary sources. The evaluation of the earthquake&#39;s intensity at 9 is based on an analysis of the destruction of buildings of raw brick, which were typical for all of Turkmenia and similar to construction in the area of the Ashkhabad earthquake of 1948. Intensity 9-10 is assumed at the epicenter. Evaluation of the depth is given roughly, taking into account the focal depths of the major earthquakes of the Ashkhabad epicentral zone.

        "comments": "365, July 21. The earthquake was a significant event in the Hellenic Arc, which affected a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean region. IT originated from somewhere between Crete and the Peloponnese. It happened in the early morning, and much if not all of the damage it caused was due to the seismic sea wave that played havoc with coastal settlements in Egypt, the Peloponnese and Sicily. (ref #9116)\r\n<p>365, July 21. E. part of the Mediterranean Sea, Hellenic Arc. On July 21, 365 before sunrise a strong earthquake [35 N, 23 E, intensity X] and a catastrophic tsunami occurred with source near Crete. About 5,000 people were killed in Greece due to the tsunami. The earthquake was also felt in northern Italy (in Verona, Bergamo, Mantua, Trevi and other cities). Cities were damaged in Libya. The earthquake caused serious damage in Nicomedia near Constantinople. Epicenters reported range from 35N, 23E, intensity X; 35.3N, 25.7E, intensity XI, magnitude 8; 35.5N, 23E; and 35N, 25E, intensity XI. (re #2130)\r\n</p><p> 46N, 12E, intensity XI. (ref #1075)\r\n</p><p>It is likely that the 365 earthquake consisted of more than one large earthquake in the eastern Mediterranean region. Indirect evidence, in need of authentification, suggests that the period 350-550 was perhaps one of the most seismically active periods in the region during the last two millennia. (ref #3845)\r\n</p><p>365 A.D. July 21. Great destructive earthquake, the most frequently mentioned and debated shock of the late antique times, with many descriptions in coeval sources. Epicenter located in the sea near the island of Crete: some suggest a location south of Crete, subsequently criticised by others that strongly support an epicenter in the Aegean Sea, north of the island. Knossos, Gortys and other towns violently affected. Event possibly felt in the whole Mediterranean, namely: Sicily, Greece, Palestine and in the Iberian Peninsula. (ref #4139)\r\n</p><p>Information below from Ref #1598\r\n</p><p>According to the historian Amminaus Marcellinus it was a frightful disaster, surpassing anything related either in legend or authentic history. According to calculations based on archaeological evidence and historical data the epicenter of this event may have been in the sea, about 50 km SW from Kourion and west of modern Limassol. Kourion, which was razed by this earthquake may have had a population of about 20,000 before it was heavily damaged by an earlier earthquake in 332 or 324 AD which had leveled the town and the port of Salmai, 110 km NE of Kurion. The Roman Empire was facing considerable difficulties at that time due to attacks by barbarian tribes, the Scots, Francs, Saxons, Picts, and Goths, and by the Persians on its eastern border. The archaeological evidence at Kourion shows that once-proud buildings had been modified to suit a dilapidating society. The population may therefore have been smaller when the cataclysm struck. </p><p>Excavations have so far concentrated on a very small part of the town, which may have covered about 10 km<sup>2</sup> at its zenith. In the few houses investigated by archaeologists so far numerous skeletons have been found, suggesting that most victims were indoors and probably still asleep when the first devastating shock arrived just after dawn. This means that the total number of people killed by this earthquake must have been high, in particular as other places along the coast must have sustained heavy damage. Moreover, many buildings consisted of rubble masonry, which makes them very vulnerable, and they therefore collapse in great numbers as soon as intensities exceed about MM or MSK VI.</p><p> Besides Kurion (Curium) there were other important towns along the S and SW coast of Cyprus, such as Amathus, 22 km to the East, Palaepaphos (Kouklia) and Paphos, 30 km and 47 km to the west. The earthquake was so devastating that Curium was abandoned. It recovered only during the 5th century, but its population even then did not exceed 2,000.</p>",

The main shock occurred on 18 October 1493, on the day of St Luke the Evangelist (18 October), one hour before daybreak. The references in the literature to an earthquake on Cos on 5 August 1493 and probably 1491 (Funes 149?, v. 8; Coronelli 1693, 317), really refer to the single event of October 1493 (A. Luttrell, personal communication, 16 March 1980).\r\n</p><p>On the island of Cos most of the houses and fortifications are reported to have collapsed in the towns of Cos (Lango), Asfendiou (Narangia), Kefalos (Kefalou), Antimachia, Kokkino (Cognino), Enteomo(?) and Pylio, where many houses and part of the walls collapsed, killing a number of the gentry and other people, injuring many, though most probably not more than 5000 as some later writers maintain. Coastal buildings collapsed and fell into the sea. After the earthquake the survivors were left in such a panic that the Grand Master had to offer them privileges to induce them not to leave Cos. It is probable that damage extended to Bodrum on the mainland, where stones from remains of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus were not used in the reconstruction of the castle before about 1494 (A. Luttrell, personal communication, 16 March 1980; Gerkan 1935, 127). There was also damage on the neighbouring islet of Yiali (Scagki), which was usually uninhabited, and it is claimed that the earthquake broke away great rocks and formed an island ( sic .) near Nissiros (Nissari).\r\n</p><p>Thus Tarcagnota&#39;s brief account places the event at the end of October 1491 (Tarcagnota 1580, ii. 516), whereas Bosio says that the earthquake occurred on 18 October 1493  &#34;one hour before sunset&#34;. He adds that as a result of the earthquakes there were &#34;public processions throughout Rhodes supplicating God for the safety of the island&#34; (Bosio 1597, xiv. 2). The earthquake in Cos, especially at Narangia, occurring &#34;one hour before sunset&#34; on 18 October, is also mentioned in a contemporary document (Anon. 1493(?), f. 110-115). Some of the seventeenth-century writers place the event in 1491, and put the loss of life at 500 (Lancellotti 1637, 50), whereas others date the earthquake to 18 (Girardi 1653 sub ann. ) or 20 October 1493 (Coronelli and Parisotti 1688, 312314) and give the exaggerated estimate of 5000 people killed on the island.</p>",

On 18 September 1601, central Switzerland was hit by one of the largest known earthquakes in central Europe (I &#61; VII-VIII, Mw - 6.2; Swiss Seismological Service, 2002). Several towers in Lucerne were destroyed, and Renward Cysat, the registrar of Lucerne at that time, reported in his chronicle, &#34;What scared people most was that the out flowing river Reuss flowed back into Lake Lucerne so that the riverbed between the two parts of the city almost became dry and several people\r\ncould cross it by foot, before the water again vehemently advanced towards the city&#34; (Cysat, 1601, p. 884). As Cysat traveled along the lake&#39;s shore, he recorded observations such as: &#34;Ships had been thrown onshore ... up to two halberds [~4 m] aboye the lake level. ... Small islands and shoals had disappeared,&#34; (p. 883) as did &#34;entire houses with sleeping people&#34; (Cysat, 1601, p. 887). In Lucerne, the cyclic oscillation of lake level (seiche) had a period of 10 min and an estimated amplitude of 1-2 m (Cysat, 1601; Siegenthaler et al., 1987). An earthquake of this magnitude could not have directly caused such massive water movements that lasted several hours. In fact, Siegenthaler et al. (1987) linked these large-scale water movements of A.D. 1601 to two large slump deposits in the subsurface of Lake Lucerne.\r\n<p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #4109:</i></blockquote> \r\n1601, September 8, 01 UTC. 46.833 N, 85 E, intensity IX.

        "comments": "More than 200 moderate to large earthquakes occurred on the New Madrid fault, 1811 to 1812. The first two occurred on December 16, 1811. Other major shocks occurred on January 23, 1812, and February 7, 1812.\r\n<p>The first earthquake caused only slight damage to man-made structures, mainly because of the sparse population in the epicentral area. The extent of the area that experienced damaging earth motion (MMI &gt;&#61; VIII) is estimated to about 600,000 km<sup>2</sup>. However, shaking strong enough to alarm the general population (MMI &gt;&#61; V) occurred over an area of 2.5 million km<sup>2</sup>.\r\n</p><p>At the onset of the earthquake the ground rose and fell--bending the trees until their branches intertwined and opening deep cracks in the ground. Landslides swept down the steeper bluffs and hillsides; large areas of land were uplifted; and still larger areas sank and were covered with water that emerged through fissures or craterlets. Huge waves on the Mississippi River overwhelmed many boats and washed others high on the shore. High banks caved and collapsed into the river; sand bars and points of islands gave way; whole islands disappeared. \r\n</p><p>The New Madrid earthquake caused very slight loss of life, as compared with most other earthquakes of similar intensity. ..whereas in the New Madrid area only a single life has been reported as lost in this manner. This immunity was due to the fact that the region of\r\ngreatest disturbance was thinly settled and without large towns with brick or stone buildings to collapse and crush the inhabitants. In this country region the buildings were mainly cabins, which were strongly built and at the same time more or less elastic. The frame houses of the larger villages were likewise of a character to give before rather than resist the vibrations. The fact that the people\r\nleft their houses at the first shock and and were in places of comparative safety when the later and more severe shocks came also has much to do with their escape. The only death on land of which accounts have been seen was that of one woman who, frightened by the shock, ran until her strength gave out and expired of fear and exhaustion. One writer tells of others who were thrown into the river by caving banks at New Madrid and drowned. None of the contemporaneous accounts, however, seem to mention the latter incident.

This was one of the most severe and destructive earthquakes on record in India. The main focus at disturbance must have been near Cutch, where the damage done was terrific. Bhaoj, the chief town, was reduced to ruins, <b>2,000 people perishing</b>; shock lasted from 2 to 3 minutes with a heavy appalling noise. At Ahmedabad, a city famous for its noble architectural remains, spires of great mosque of Sultan Ahmed were overthrown; other mosques also destroyed; 500 people assembled for a wedding feast, all perished in ruins. At Surat, motion heavy, but destruction of buildings slight. At Broach, motion very heavy. At Poonah, only slightly felt. The shock extended right over the north of India; was felt sharply at Sultanpur in Qudh, Jaunpore, Chunar and Mirzapur, and at Calcutta. In Cutch, first shock at few minutes before 7 p.m. of 16th: shocks continued of lesser intensity until 20th, when, it is stated, the &#39;volcano called Denodur burst into action, and the shocks ceased: (Denodur, however, is not a volcano). In the western portion, the town of Sindree and adjoining country were inundated by a tremendous rush from the ocean, and all submerged, the ground sinking apparently about 14 feet. While to the north of this tract, about 5 miles, a long low ridge or swell of perhaps 15 miles in width, was said to have been raised and to extend 50 miles east and west. It passed immediately across the channel of the Indus. The natives called this the Allah Bund, or Mound of God. The elevation was nowhere more than 10 feet. It wall afterwards cut through by the Indus, and was found to be composed of clay with imbedded shells. In the Ruun of Cutch, numerous jets of blackish, muddy water were thrown out from fissures, and cones of sand, 6 and 8 feet high, were thrown up. (reference #4110)\r\n</p><p>1819, June 16. Cutch, Felt practically over the whole of India, including Calcutta, and was one of the greatest of Indian earthquakes, 2000 lives lost at Bhuj alone. The great mosque of Sultan Ahmed at Ahmedabad destroyed after\r\nstanding 450 years. An elevation of the ground for 80 miles on the north side of a fault running east-west, temporarily dammed up a branch of the Indus. The Rann of Cutch flooded on the downthrow side of the fault. (reference #1095)\r\n</p><p>1819, June 16. The known total <b>loss of life, according to Macmurdo, amounted to 1,543</b>, namely, 1,140 at Bhuj, 165 at Anjar, 73 at Mothala, 65 at Tera, 45 at Mandir, 34 at Kothara, 13 at Lakhput and 8 at Naliyat. (reference #516)\r\n</p><p>1819, June 16. At approximately 7 p.m., on 16 June 1819, Fort Sindri and masonry buildings in villages within a radius of 80 km were destroyed by a violent earthquake... Reliable eyewitness reports near the epicenter are available only from Bhooj and Anjar from where the British resident (Captain James MacMurdo) and an army officer (Lt. Colonel Colin Milnes) sent daily dispatches to the Government at Bombay. MacMurdo lists <b>1543 people killed</b> in the event, mostly in Anjar and Bhooj where 1547 houses were completely destroyed and many more damaged. MacMurdo remarks that &#34;had the accident occurred in the night time, perhaps one third if the population of the province would have been buried in the ruins of their dwelling-houses&#34;. He observes that damage to masonry structures was minor where these were constructed on rock, but catastrophic where constructed on soils. Macmurdo&#39;s meticulous records probably underestimate the total number of fatalities because they fail to record damage in the northern Rann of Kachchh and southern Scinde Province, which regions appear to have been close to the epicenter...

        "comments": "1835, February 20, (approximately 11:30). There was a destructive earthquake (37N 73W, mag 8.25) and tsunami in the center part of Chile with its source near Concepcion. It is possible that there were foreshock warnings, for on Feb 14, Santiago experienced a weak shock which lasted 20 seconds. The earthquake began in Concepcion with weak tremors which quickly became stronger. For the first half minute no one seemed alarmed but then all the inhabitants fled from their houses. It became impossible, not only to move from one place to another, but even to stand without some kind of support. Even when lying on the ground, one had to hold onto\r\nsomething in order not to roll about. Some horsemen were thrown from their saddles; others fell, together with their horses, but none of them could remain mounted. There were many instances of seasickness. Then a severe shock which lasted 5-10 seconds, toppled over and destroyed almost all the buildings. In many places cracks opened up in the ground with a deafening crash. A thick cloud of suffocating dust rose into the air from the wrecked buildings and from the ground. All this took about two minutes from the start of the earthquake.<p>The city of Concepcion is situated on a low terrace of the river Bio-Bio on alluvial soils. On the east and north the valley is bounded by hills formed of tertiary shale rock. Apparently, the sedimentary cover settled, owing to the effect of the earthquake. Severe fragmentation occurred at the foot of the hills and the whole valley was dotted with cracks 2-30 cm in width.</p><p> Washerwomen repeated, that at the start of the earthquake, the water at the river bank suddenly rose approximately half a metre. A similar occurrence was observed in the mouth of the river at Lirquen. </p><p>As a result of the earthquake, more than <b>50 persons were killed</b>, 10 were seriously injured, 30 were missing and more than 500 suffered concussion or injuries, out of a total population of over 5,000 (700-800, by other accounts). The casualties would have been greater if it had not been summer daytime and the quakes had not increased gradually. There were many cases of persons going out of their mind. Almost all mud brick houses were leveled to the ground. Houses of kiln dried brick suffered less, although they became unfit for habitation; in 2-story houses the upper stories collapsed and the lower were damaged. A single, 2-story building with supporting columns survived - the construction of its roof had just been completed. With the collapse of fireplaces and the falling of thatched roofs, quite a number of fires occurred, but they were all quickly extinguished.</p><p>In a technical report, compiled half a year after the earthquake, the percentages of completely collapsed houses, and houses that were damaged but still standing, were estimated as follows according to type: brick, 33 and 67%; mud brick, 71 and 29%; stone construction 95 and 5%.</p><p>This quake damaged buildings as far south as Osorno (40.58S, 73.23W), and as far north as San Fernando (34.67S, 71W). The area in which the earthquake was felt, extended from Copiapo (27.33S, 70.38W) in the north, to the island of Chiloe (42.5S, 73.92W) in the south, and from the island of Juan Fernandez (33S, 80W) in the west, where the earthquake was fairly strong, to Mendosa (30.5S,70.92W) in the east.</p><p> In Concepcion the ground shook almost continuously for a period of three days. The many aftershocks were preceded by sounds resembling a distant artillery cannonade. More than 300 tremors were counted between February 20 and March 4. </p><p>(above from ref #415)\r\n</p><p>The island of Quiriquina was uplifted 8 feet, Santa Maria Island 8 to 10 feet, Talcahuano 4 to 5 feet, Tubul 6 feet [...] Most of the uplift disappeared during the aftershock sequence. Subsidence was reported in the Maule estuary. (ref #12425)\r\n</p><p>1835, Feb 20, 15:30 UTC. 36.83 S, 73.03 W, magnitude 8.1 MS, intensity XI, tsunami generated, casualties. (ref #1206)</p>",

Some Japanese sources mention that on this day a small tsunami was noticed on all the Ryukyu Islands, and surmise that it was caused by the earthquake in\r\nEcuador, or by one of the aftershocks of the Arica earthquake of Aug 13, 1868. A catastrophic earthquake in Ecuador and southwestern Colombia occurred on the 16th at 1:15 [local time]. The cities Otavalo, Catocachi, Ibarra, Atuntaqui [situated 10 km west of Ibarra] and San Pablo were destroyed. An estimated 40,000 people died in Ecuador and 30,000 in Colombia. The source of the earthquake was apparently situated 100 km east of Quito, in the region of the western spurs of the Andes, that is, quite far from the coast. [There are no data at all on the occurrence of the tsunami off the coast of Ecuador, Colombia or Peru or in the central part of the Pacific. Most likely it was a reflection of the Arica tsunami.] (reference #415)\r\n</p><p>1868. The city of Ibarra was sleeping quiet and boastful during the night of the unfortunate Aug 16th when at lh:15m, the most violent earthquake among the spaniard anales in America. In less than 3 sec transformed the city in a big and gloomy burying ground... It is necessary to recall that the catastrophe of 16th was preceding at 15th by a movement which was softly perceived a few leguas to the North, in which it ruined the town of El Angel: - Took a long relation of this earthquake, made by P. Federico C. Aguilar S.J., member of a government investigative commission; this relation is on his book &#34;Memoria sobre las oscilaciones de la brujula - Anadese breve resumen de los fenomenos que a companaron al &#34;terremoto del 16 de Agosto de 1868&#34; - 1868. </p><p>About the great damages and numerous victims only we will make reference to a few words of the governor of Imbabura when he communicated the news to the Central Government: &#34;Among the consternation of the few persons which were still alive surrounded by these country ruins, I am writing you to inform that on Sunday at one o&#39;clock A.M., the city of Ibarra was shaken by an earthquake. There are only ruins and perhaps one sixth of the population&#34; Reference of &#34;Elenco Histarico ...&#34; </p><p>Concerning the effects of the earthquake of Ibarra in Quito, P. Aguilar express; &#34;In appearance all foreboded one placid and clear tropical night as there are at July and August; but, suddenly at 1h:40m, a dull and remote noise was perveiving, which was quickly approximating and increasing like a thunder repeated by echo; there was a soft ondulatory movement, but, suddenly the soil was shaking furiously, mixing the shakes with the ondulations. Fortunately that shake durated only 15 seconds, but on the contrary, no one stone above a stone was resting in Quito. When finally cleared we became stupefied when we saw the mark of the earthquake printed upon all the buildings of the city, specially the public buildings. The temples of Sn. Agustin, the two Carmenes and Sta. Clara became almost completely ruined. The other churches and convents suffered great damages such as the Campania which suffered the new tower shrinkage. </p><p>(above from reference #1106)</p>",

On Saturday 29th of December about 18\r\nminutes to 8 p.m. we had a quite severe earthquake, the\r\nheaviest I had felt since I came here in August 1886.\r\nAbout 11 p.m. the same night there was another of equal\r\nintensity and lasting twice as long. Near 4 a.m. Sunday\r\nmorning the 30th of December a tremendous shock reoccurred,\r\nsaid by all to be the heaviest experienced since\r\n1841. The central battlement between the two towers\r\nforming the front of the cathedral fell, part outward\r\ncrushing the roof of the portico, and part within crushing\r\nthe roof gallery and organ of the cathedral. Both towers\r\nare cracked loose from the main body all the way to the\r\nground.\r\n</p><p>The president&#39;s palace is cracked at the corners and\r\nconsiderably damaged. The new union bank, a large\r\nbuildings ... is greatly damaged. Cracked at the corners and other places; part of one wall and part of the roof\r\nfallen. The cathedral walls are about eight feet thick,\r\nthose of the union bank . . . five feet thick. The towers of\r\nthe principal churches are cracked all round. Private\r\nhouses are greatly damaged, some entirely unsafe, and a\r\nlarge number of families are camping out in tents.. . .\r\nIn Cartago the shock was light and no damage done.\r\nIn Alajuela the shock was as hard or harder than San\r\nJod and equal damage .... Between Poas and Barba the\r\ncountry, I am told, is much broken up-great landslides\r\non the mountains, rivers diverted from their courses,\r\nhills appearing where there were before level meadows\r\nand vice versa and fissures in the earth. One home was\r\ncompletely swallowed up in the neighborhood of Poas.\r\nOf the family the mother with one child ran out in time\r\nand was saved; but the <b>father and five children went\r\ndown with the house. In San Jose there were quite a\r\nnumber buried by falling plaster and tiles; some limbs\r\nbroken and dislocated, one man crushed by a falling roof\r\nand two very old ladies died of fright</b> (Mansfield 1888).\r\n</p><blockquote><i>Reference #124</i></blockquote>\r\n1888, December 30, 0412 local time. The duration of this earthquake, &#34;chronograph in hand&#34; was 25 seconds (Gonzalez Viquez, 1910). It completely destroyed a few houses, damaged many others in San Jose de Costa Rica and there were collapses along the Poas, one of which covered 5 people. In addition to the capital, which was the most affected, Alajuela and Heredia suffered considerably, as well as Alajuelita (see Annals of the Center for Seismological Studies of Costa Rica, 1911).\r\n<p>The intensity of the commotion was greater to the western side of the country, with a focus closer to the Pacific. The total balance is given by Gonzalez Viquez: 201 fallen buildings, 1226 disabled and 2232 requiring repair. Among public buildings, 12 collapsed or became unusable and 39 had to be repaired. According to Pittier (1889) in Fraijanes, at the foot of the south-east fault of the Poas, here is scarcely a house that has resisted.

A Bushire telegram states that the latest news from Qishm reports that 1,400 bodies have been recovered from the ruins (The Times January 25, 1897 p.5b). An official report from the Governor of Banda-Abbas to the Governor of Bushire said - &#34;From seven hour after sunset on Sunday night the 10th of January, until dawn we had three severe shocks of earthquake, which caused terrible fright throughout the neighbourhood. The people all went out of the town to seek succour from God through His Holy Apostles. Two hours before sunset on Monday, the 11th of January, a boat arrived from Qishm and brought the sad news that an earthquake had played havoc with all the houses of that island. After making proper inquiries from the captain of the boat I was able to gather that the whole market place and the houses had been totally wrecked, hardly ten houses remaining intact. Ten thousand people (men, women and children) are said to have been buried alive. The island of Qishm is in total ruins. Undoubtedly not more than 100 persons could have escaped with their lives as the night was very cold and the people were sleeping in their rooms (The Times March 13, 1897, p. 5c).\r\nJanuary 11, at night Qishm town was leveled to the ground. <b>1,600 people were killed</b>. Only two mosques and three or four other buildings were left standing. There was loss of life also on the island of Larak and the shock was felt as far to the west as Lingeh (Persian Gulf Gazetteer; Nature, 55, 176, Lond, 1897; Sykes 1902; Milne 1911; Wilson 1930).

The greatest destruction occurred at Quesaltenango, San Pedro and Solola. In particular, a church built during the Spanish Conquest collapsed. The coast in the Ocosa region subsided 1 m.

Since that time the tremors have been continuous throughout the western department, particularly in the region of Santa Maria. (reference #7815)\r\n</p><p>At 8:25 p.m. of April 18 an earthquake of more than thirty seconds duration affected a large part of Guatemala, eastern Chiapas and western Salvador and Honduras. The intensity of the movement was greatest in western Guatemala, where the second and richest city of the country, Quezaltenango, was completely destroyed, with the loss of about 500 lives. Completely ruined also were Solola, San Marcos and its sister town San Pedro Sacatepequez (more than 200 lives being lost), and the same happened to Retalhuleu and Mazatenango, important towns on the Pacific coast plain, to the south of Quezaltenango. The places before mentioned are situated on the highlands, a little to the north of the great volcanoes.\r\n</p><p>Besides the cities named, nearly every town and hamlet in the Departamentos of San Marcos, Quezaltenango, Retalhuleu, Suchitepequez and several in Chimaltenango are ruined, and perhaps every one of the many important coffee- and sugar-plantations in the western coast-region has had its buildings machinery and the aqueducts ruined. The total number of lives lost may be about 800 to 900.\r\n</p><p>At the port of Ocos, only three houses remained standing and the big landing-pier was broken near the land.\r\n</p><p>In the city of Guatemala most of the churches and some houses sustained slight damages; the same happened in Antigua (Guatemala). Escuintla and Amatitlan suffered considerably.\r\n</p><p>The railways between Retalhuleu and the port of Champerico and the one between Ocos and Coatepec were interrupted by the falling of bridges and damage to the road.

The earthquake began with comparatively weak oscillations, which then became strong tremors. The oscillations were so strong at Mexico, that sleepers awoke and ran to the street, the beams of buildings shook, and electrical and telegraph wires in the street became entangled. Several buildings and walls collapsed. The oscillations lasted about 2 minutes. Several new huts, woven of branches, collapsed at San Marcos: mongooses were thrown from trees to the ground. The majority of stone\r\nhomes were destroyed at Ayutla and eight persons were killed. At Acapulco, the buildings suffered only slight damage. The water left the Chacalapa lagoon situated on the coast south of San Marcos; the cabins with baths here were buried in the sand to a depth of 1 1/2 m; large trees fell. During April, numerous recurrent shocks were felt in the epicentral zone. After the earthquake, the sea rushed onshore on the entire stretch of road from Acapulco to Tecuanapa road, which served as a port for the city of Ometepec.

        "comments": "One of the worst earthquakes ever felt in Burma [Mynamar] occurred on May 5, 1930 at 13:45:58 UTC. The ancient seaport of Pegu was almost entirely destroyed by the earthquake and sea wave (tsunami) which followed it. The roof of the famous Shwemawdaw Pagoa, reported to be entirely covered with gold and very valuable, was wrecked. The earthquake caused the practical destruction of the town of <b>Pegu</b> with the <b>loss of at least 500 lives</b>; it was felt as far as the Kyaukpyu and Murgui districts up and down the coasts respectively, as far north as Mongmit in the northern Shan States, across the greater part of the southern Shan States and the Kingdom of Siam [Thailand]. The outer curve marking these approximate limits passes into the Bay of Bengal, the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Siam [Thailand], but the land area actually involved was not less than 220,000 sq. miles. The region of maximum intensity lies within isoseismal IX on the RF [Rossi-Forel Intensity] scale, and embraces 375 sq. miles elongated pear-shaped area south of Pegu itself to beyond Thongwa - a distance of 45 miles as the crow flies. At Pegu itself a considerable portion of the town was ruined and fire, which broke out at once, added to the horror of the situation. Large cracks appeared in the ground and exuded sand and water. Big pieces of the river bank slid into the stream. Within the epicentral tract, the Tawa lock of the Pegu-Sittang canal, together with the adjoining country, was raised 0.77 feet. (reference #1185)\r\n<p>Only tonight is it possible to estimate the full effects of the appalling earthquake which yesterday wrought havoc in Burma [Myanmar] and shattered the town of <b>Pegu</b>, 58 miles north of Rangoon, which was afterward almost completely destroyed by fire. Between <b>5,000 and 7,000 persons, it is believed tonight, perished</b> in southern Burma [Mynamar], either in the first crash of falling buildings or in the fire and tidal waves [tsunami] along the Sittang River which followed quickly after the nerve-shattering earthquake. The motion of the earth was so violent three miles north of Pegu that the magnificent steel bridge on the Rangoon-Mandalay Railroad came crashing down. The <b>casualties in Rangoon itself are officially put at 58 killed and 204 injured</b>, no Europeans being among them. The heaviest casualties occurred in the vicinity of the famous Shwe-Dagon pagoda, which since the 16th century, has been one of the greatest pilgrimage shrines of Buddhism. The glittering weather vane, richly studded with jewels, which crowned the conical gold tower of the pagoda and was valued at more than $1,250,000, toppled into the gardens 370 feet below. More than 50 large buildings will have to be reconstructed. (reference #2706)\r\n</p><p>As the commercial center of the British colony of Burma, the Irrawaddy River valley attracted numerous commercial wet-rice planters from the 1850s, funded by money lenders from Calcutta (Kolkata), India, a source of later friction between independent India and Burma. From 1855 to 1930, the area cultivated for rice increased from 988,000 acres (400,000 hectares) to 9.8 million acres (4 million hectares), and the population increased from 1.5 million to 8 million. (reference #9246)\r\n</p><p>One of the worst earthquakes ever felt in Burma [Myanmar] occurred on May 5th. The time of origin is given by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey as 13:45:32 GMT. The ancient seaport of <b>Pegu</b> was almost entirely destroyed by the earthquake and a sea wave which followed it. <b>Hundreds of people were reported killed or injured</b>. <b>Rangoon</b> suffered heavily from the shocks.

The first shock [17.3N 96.5E] at about 10:30 p.m. on December 3rd [local time, 16:36:20 UTC Dec. 3] was a mild tremor felt in Rangoon. The second shock [18.2N 96.4E] at 1:20 a.m. on December 4th [local time, 18:51:51 UTC Dec. 3] was much more severe. Press report stated that at least 36 persons were killed as a result of the shocks and many more were injured. The area between Nyaunglebin and Toungoo, of which Pyu is the center, was apparently hardest hit. Buildings were destroyed, but most them were of flimsy construction. In Pegu, Upper Burma [Myanmar], three very severe shocks, lasting 45 seconds were felt, but these did very little property damage as most of the buildings had been destroyed in the earthquake of May, 1930, and reconstructed later along earthquake-proof lines. Many railway bridges throughout the country were damaged and the telegraphic service was completely disrupted. Many freight cars and one locomotive were derailed and turned over. \r\n<p>According to the Bangkok Times of December 4th, 1930:--At two o&#39;clock this morning a number of people were conscious of earthquake shocks. There was no wind at the time, yet doors were heard to bang though not apparently loudly, and most of the people awake at the time asked themselves if their houses were not moving. The most striking evidence, however comes from the resident who saw the water in the Klong Sen Sep [Bangkok] greatly agitated and overflowing its banks more than once. Another reader reported that the shocks stopped both his clocks at the same instant and that several of his neighbors also experienced this.\r\n<br />(above from reference #1185)\r\n</p><p>Reference #1250 lists 36 deaths.</p>",

This event occurred 250-350 west of Karachi and was recorded globally. Walton&#39;s 1864 concerns about submarine cables were borne out when this earthquake occurred, as cables broke in eight places due to submarine slides. To reconcile observed shoreline uplift with the mechanism of the earthquake, Byrne et al. (1992) argue for a rupture on a thrust plane with a 5 deg dip, extending 70-90 km inland to 10-30 km offshore. Based on the distribution of intensities, morphological changes, and the sparse distribution of recorded aftershocks, the rupture is inferred to have propagated south-southeast with a duration of 56 s, suggesting a rupture dimension of 80-150 km extending eastward from Pasni. Numerous mud volcanoes erupted inland and offshore, creating four transient islands of stiff clay with 200-300 m dimensions in ~10m water depths coastward of a line connecting the horsts at Pasni and Ormara. The coastline at Pasni subsided and the tombola at Ormara was raised 2 m. Numerous aftershocks were recorded and locally felt (ref #1117); (ref #10754)).

Southern Magallanes Province, near Punta Arenas, Chile. A series of strong earthquakes rocked the Western Hemisphere&#39;s southernmost tip, Tierra del Fuego, from dawn until noon. Walls tumbled in the Chilean city of Punta Arenas and minor damage was done at Ushuaia, capital of the Argentine portion of Tierra del Fuego. No casualties were reported from the sparsely populated region despite four major and four lesser shocks. Six other temblors were recorded. The final one wrecked the walls of the boy&#39;s high school in Punta Arenas and toppled part of the Yugoslav community&#39;s Dalmatia Club. Telegraph and telephone lines between Punta Arenas and Santiago, Chile, were disrupted. A radio-telegraph operator at Punta Arenas reported that until 2 p.m. the earth continued to tremble and underground rumblings were heard. The US Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey gives the time of the main shock as 15:07:53, GCT, with a foreshock at 06:53:29, and provisional epicenter 54 S, 71 W. Pasadena estimated the magnitude of the main shock to be 7.5; of the foreshock 7.25. The Jesuit Seismological Assoc gives the time of the first shock as 06:53:30 and tentative epicenter 53.3 S, 71 W.

A foreshock was felt at about 02:50 a.m. The intensity at Punta Arenas was around 7; no casualties occurred in the town itself. Most of the damage was due to the collapse of firewalls between wooden houses. No damage was reported from the oilfields on Tierra del Fuego Island. About 2 dozen aftershocks were felt the first day. Landslides occurred along the west coast of Tierra del Fuego, particularly at San Nicolas, in Admiralty Bay, and along the banks of Lake Fagnano and the Belverde River. Three persons were killed at a lumber mill which was destroyed by a large landslide at San Nicolas, about 50 km south of Punta Arenas. Jets of salt water were reported squirting from the ground at that locality. Local tsunami waves and abnormally strong tidal currents were observed on Porvenir, in Admiralty Bay, in the Zigzag Channel near Gabriel Canal, and at other points. The epicenter was located presumably on the fault structure which includes Lake Fagnano and the western arm of the Magellan Straits; but it was closer to Lake Fagnano than to Punta Arenas.

Galanopoulos has published a series of significant photographs (Seismological\r\nInstitute Bulletin, 1955). The relatively small number\r\nof victims is due to the fact that a slight shock gave\r\nthe alarm seven seconds before the main shock; several ships were caught in a tsunami in the harbour at Volos.

The epicentre of the earthquake was computed by several seismological centers with the following results: BCIS 37.9 N, 55.9 E; USCGS, 37.8 N - 55.9 E. The magnitude of the shock calculated by different stations varied between 6.3 and 6.7 (MS).</p><p>The shock was felt over an area of about 100,000 square kilometres, and preliminary focal depth determinations indicate a very shallow focus, less than 20 kilometres deep. There were comparatively few aftershocks, all of low magnitude, which added very little to the damage caused by the main shock.</p><p>The Karnaveh earthquake occurred in the upper reaches of the Gorgan River, in what used to be called eastern Sahra-i-Turlonan, a rather isolated and thinly populated area south of the River Atrek. The main shock affected an area of about 7,000 square kilometres with a population density of about two per square kilometre. The exact number of people killed is not known but it is probably between 180 and 250. More than 450 people were injured and about 2,000 housing units were destroyed or damaged in 40 villages and settlements.</p><p>The earthquake occurred very early in the morning when most of the men were at dawn prayers in the open courtyards and it was mainly women and children who were killed. The largest settlements in the area affected by the earthquake were Karnaveh, Agheman, Chenaran, Gholidagh Shabrak and Yemlak. A number of smaller settlements however, such as Baba Shamalakand Meydanjik, situated in the middle of a barren region, suffered greater damage.</p><p>With very few exceptions, all houses in the affected region are of adobe brick or mud-wall construction, with flat roofs made from timber beams and covered with a mud/straw mixture. There are very few well-built houses and no other construction that could serve as a measure for assessing intensities. Thus from the behaviour of local houses alone we could not determine intensities greater than about VII (MM). There is some indirect evidence, however, indicating that the maximum intensity did not exceed VIII (MM).</p><p>(above from reference #3652)</p><p>July 30, 1970, 00:52:19.5, 37.8 N, 55.9 E, Iran-USSR border, depth 19 km, magnitude 6.6 MS. 176 killed, 483 injured, 10,000 homeless and extensive property damage in cities of northwestern Khorasan Province, Iran.

The epicenter was 75 km northwest of Santiago. Thousands of people were stranded without electricity, drinking water, or telephone service. Several communities were isolated by landslides which blocked highways and railroad tracks. The port of Valparaiso suffered the most. The maximum intensity of X points on the Rossi-Fore1 scale was observed in Ilapel and Salamanca where nearly 30 buildings were destroyed or damaged. In Valparaiso and Vina del Mar the earthquake was felt with intensities of VI1 and IX points. In La Ligua nearly 80 buildings were destroyed or damaged and in Llay-Llay the number was 90. In Santiago, crowds of frightened people ran through the streets. Building walls cracked and water jets gushed from broken mains. Damage was also reported from Conception Island. Shocks were felt in Mendoza, Tucuman, Bahia Blanca, La Plata, San Juan, Cordoba, and Buenos Aires (Argentina).

Damaged region extended over 1000 sq km. Felt widely in southern Iran.(ref #1053)</p><p>On April 10, 1972, for the fourth time in the last 15 years, Iran was shocked by a major earthquake and the resulting loss of life and property. Over 30,000 lives were lost, and numerous villages were totally destroyed by the four disasters [1957, 1962, 1968, 1972]. Nearly 100 villages, located within 50 km of the center of damage, were seriously affected by the shock. About 90 per cent of the buildings, primarily residences, in the area were damaged. Of a total population of about 23,000 people, nearly 5400 were killed, about 1700 injured during the earthquake. Population in the epicentral region is concentrated in two valleys, each about 7 by 20 km in extent, separated by a low (~ 400 m) ridge. General destruction occurred throughout this area, encompassing the major town of Qir (pre-earthquake population 5068, 3399 killed), and the village groups of the Karzin area to the east and the Afzar area in the valley to the southwest. Destruction of buildings was essentially total in these areas, where about one fourth of the population perished. The earthquake was generally felt in the major city of Shiraz (population around 250,000) to the north, where intensity would appear to have been around MM III. At Jahrom to the east and Firuzabad to the northwest, both major towns about 75 km from the epicenter, some damage occurred. In Jahrom, several houses collapsed and some other buildings suffered cracking. Intensity was about MM V. Effects in Firuzabad were reportedly similar, without serious damage. At greater distances, the earthquake was felt to a radius of about 400 km, an area of some 500,000 sq km. It was generally felt at Shiraz (160 km) and was reported felt in Bandar Abbas (about 350 km). (ref #4087)</p><p>A heavy toll was taken by the earthquake of 10 April 1972 in the province of Fars (Iran): <strong>5,374 persons killed, 1,710 injured</strong>, 45 villages completely destroyed, 64 others damaged, in an area 100km long and 30 km wide. The epicentral area lies in the Zagros mountains, in a zone of very recent folding due to compression connected with the opening of the Red Sea and the drift of Africa towards the north-east. [...] The epicentral area, in which intensity IX was reached and probably exceeded, is relatively thinly populated; loss of life occurred mainly in the town of Ghir, where 75 per cent of the population was killed (3,069 dead); the town itself was completely destroyed. 400 persons were reported killed at Gavaki, 300 at Bayan and 150 at Sag Ravan. The zone of maximum intensity is elongated in a NW.-SE. direction, parallel to the tectonic features of the region [...]The shock was widely felt at Lar, Shiraz, Kazerun and Jahrom. It was preceded by a foreshock on 3 April at 08.06 h (28.5 N., 52.6 E.; m: 4.7) and followed by numerous aftershocks.

At least <b>121 people reported killed</b>, more than <b> 1,000 injured</b>, 100,000 reported homeless and extensive damage (IX) along the southwestern coast of Yugoslavia. Local tsunami reported in Kotor Bay causing considerable damage. 35 people reported killed, 400 injured and extensive damage (VIII) in northern Albania. Also felt over a wide area of Europe. (reference #1053)\r\n<p>A strong earthquake struck the Montenegro, Yugoslavia coast at 7:20 am (06:20 UTC) on April 15, 1979. The earthquake caused damage over a large area and was felt as far away as the northern Alpine foreland, some 900 km distant. Most of the damage was restricted to Montenegro and northern Albania, more precisely to 100 km of the coastal region between Herceg-Novi on the north and Skadar on the south, extending some 25 km inland. The intensity of the April 15 earthquake did not exceed a Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) IX anywhere, and in most places within the damage zone it would correspond to MMI VII. The maximum intensity reached MMI VIII-IX in the area around Bar, whereas in Dubrovnik and Titograd the intensity was about MMI VI. Frequent aftershocks caused additional damage to buildings that had been severely damaged by the Apri1 15 earthquake; several buildings collapsed during the major aftershock on May 23. The number of people <b>killed</b> by\r\nby the earthquake was officially reported as <b>96</b> in Yugoslavia and<b> 35</b> in Albania. More than <b>1000 people were injured</b>, and about 80,000, 1/7 of the population of Montenegro, were made homeless. The loss of life and personal injuries were substantially lower than in the Skopje, Yugoslavia earthquake of July 26, 1963 when more than 1000 persons were killed. The small number of deaths and injuries is presumably a result of the fact that the earthquake occurred on a Sunday prior to the tourist\r\nseason, when both the shipyard and hotels were empty. The estimate of total loss has increased from an initial estimate of $500 million (U.S.) to from <b>$2.7 to $3.5 billion (U.S.)</b>. This substantially exceeds the loss in the Skopje earthquake of 1963. Although the individual degree of destruction was considerably lower than in Skopje, the losses aggregate to a high value because of the large area affected.

Nerarly all buildings were destroyed in the village of Khillari. Felt in large parts of central and southern India, including Bangalore, Bombay, Hyderabad and Madras. (reference #1053)\r\n<p>September 29, 1993, 9,748 killed, 30,000 injured, $280 million damage. (reference #1250)\r\n</p><p>After the Koyna earthquake of 11 December 1967, which was of magnitude 6.8, the present earthquake of magnitude 6.4 on 30 September 1993 has been the major seismic event in this part of the country. The epicentre of this event has been identified by the USGS as 18.22 N, 76.356 E. However NGRI, Hyderabad has fixed the epicentre as 18 N, 76.5 E. The focal depth is estimated to be between 5 and 15 km. During the earthquake, the ground reportedly shook for about 30 to 40s destroying about 25 villages such as Khilari, Kavatha, Sastur, Rajegaon, Ekkundi, Pethsanghavi among several others in the epicentral tract. Prior\r\nto the main shock, there were many reports of earth\r\ntremors from these places. Events which preceded the\r\nmain event by about a month had magnitudes ranging\r\nfrom 3.2 to 5.1. The severest of these, with M &#61; 5.1,\r\noccurred on 28 August 1993. During the three month\r\nperiod 1-10-1993 to 30-12-1993, several aftershocks with\r\nmore than ten events having magnitude greater than 4\r\nhave originated from the epicentral region. The epicentral intensity is estimated to be VIII. This drops by one unit beyond about 15 km from the epicentre. (reference #1254)\r\n</p><p>The devastating Latur earthquake of 30 September 1993\r\nof Mw 6.2, mb 6.3 and Imax of VIII (18 deg 03 min N; 76 deg 33 min E) occurred in the early morning of 30 September (29 September UTC) 1993 in the southern parts of Latur district in Maharashtra. The earthquake caused widespread damage in 80 villages. In the days that followed, about 10,000 human bodies were extricated from the debris, making the Latur earthquake the deadliest one to strike a stable continental\r\nregion. The earthquake was caused by an approximately\r\n45 deg SW dipping thrust at a depth of about 3 km in the Archean granite-gneiss basement of Dharwar Craton. Nevertheless, Kayal et al., based on the composite focal mechanism solutions, showed that the region beneath the epicentral zone of the earthquake is mainly characterized by strike-slip movement at shallow depths (<u></u> 5 km) and thrust movement at deeper depths (&gt; 5 km). He also drew attention towards the possibility of water percolation from Makni reservoir at shallow depths, which might have caused the Latur earthquake sequence. This idea of RTS near the Killari region was further supported by Seeber et al. Nevertheless, Rastogi showed that the Latur earthquake sequence does not satisfy the necessary conditions for the reservoir-induced/triggered earthquakes. (reference #1266)\r\n</p><p>A devastating earthquake of magnitude 6.4 occurred in the early morning of 30 September 1993in the southern part of the Latur District of Maharashtra State in India. The earthquake caused widespread damage in some 80 villages. In the days that followed, more than <b>11,000 human bodies</b> were extricated from the debris, and the reported death toll is estimated to be much more. Historically, no significant earthquake is reported to have occurred in this area. With the death toll exceeding 11,000 human lives, the Latur earthquake is globally the deadliest earthquake in the stable continental crust to have occurred in recorded history.

There was a strong earthquake on the Dumaguete Peninsula (southeast of Negros Island). The settlements of Tolong, Siaton, Tanhay, Bais and others, situated on filled-in ground or on the swampy Quaternary and Tertiary terraces, fringing the steep slopes of the ancient Tigas volcano which makes up the peninsula, suffered most of all. It was mainly poorly built structures and those which had long needed repairs which were damaged: the sugar factories at Bais and Isabela, the school, the church, the monastery and the town hall at Siaton, the monastery and town hall at Tanhay. Some of these were pile structures with weak supports (of rotted beams) and heavy roofs. Brick chimneys of old sugar mills collapsed and the weak parts of the old churches and monasteries fell everywhere at a distance of up to 125 km from the source of Negros Island. \r\n</p><p>On the neighboring islands, Cebu, Siquijor, and Mindanao, at the same distance from the epicenter, the earthquake was less strong. Many collapses, landslides and mudslides occurred along the valleys of the channels on the steep slopes of the Dumaguete Peninsula; <b>17 people died</b> as a result.

The macroseismic epicenter was determined at the southern coast of the island of Viti-Levu. Cave-ins, and landslides occurred on the steep slopes nearshore and bridges were damaged. Considerable material damage was sustained. On loose ground the destruction was noticeably stronger than in bedrock areas. The most frequent cause of the destruction of buildings and bridges was the sinking of filled ground. The dock area of Suva was damaged most of all. The back-filled soil subsided and was displaced one meter towards the water. This resulted in considerable destruction of berthage, supporting walls and access roads. After the earthquake, the caved-in areas had to be filled in. The ground cracked in low places near the shore; numerous small sand and mud volcanoes appeared. <b>Two persons perished, one under a landslide, the other by the collapse of a building.</b>\r\n<p>The earthquake was followed by a large number of weak aftershocks.\r\n</p><p>According to eyewitnesses, the water level at the entrance to the harbour of Suva began to recede immediately after the seismic shocks.  <b>In Suva, three persons were drowned in the tsunami waves and two on the island of Kandavu.

Felt (IV) at Lhasa. Also felt at Thimphu,\r\nBhutan. \r\n<p>The eastern Xizang earthquake of October 6, 2008 occurred as a result of normal faulting in the Tibetan Plateau. The style of faulting is inferred from the characteristics of seismic waves radiated by the earthquake source. The faulting that caused the earthquake is a consequence of predominantly east-west oriented extensional stress that ultimately arises from the convergence of the India plate northwards with respect to the Eurasia plate at a rate of over 40 mm/yr. This convergence drives the uplift of the Himalaya Mountains and Tibetan Plateau and produces generally north-south compressional stresses on the north and south margins of the plateau. The plateau interior is spreading to the east and, as a result, is an area of east-west extension within the larger region of north-south compression. The epicentral region of the 2008 earthquake previously experienced a magnitude 6.1 normal faulting earthquake on July 30, 1992 \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)</p>",

Rescue officials said the death toll could climb, with several hard-hit remote areas yet to be reached.\r\nThe 7.0-magnitude quake struck beneath the ocean floor off the northern coast of Papua province at around noon Wednesday, the U.S. Geological Survey said on its website. A series of strong aftershocks followed, the highest measuring 6.4, adding to the widespread panic.\r\nOne of the victims was a 5-month-old baby, crushed by rubble when his family house collapsed on Yapen, an island closest to the epicenter, said Priyadi Kardono, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency. A woman also was killed, he said, and several people were hospitalized in critical condition. More than 500 island homes were damaged, he said, many of them badly. Sumpeno Yuwono, a top search and rescue official, said if reports from village chiefs were correct, almost all houses in nine yet-to-be-reached villages along Yapen&#39;s southern coast also suffered significant damage.

The majority of\r\ncasualties and damage occurred in Iwate, Miyagi and\r\nFukushima from a Pacific-wide tsunami with a maximum\r\nrunup height of 37.88 m at Miyako. The total economic\r\nloss in Japan was estimated at 309 billion US dollars.\r\nElectricity, gas and water supplies, telecommunications and railway service disrupted and several reactors severely damaged at a nuclear power plant near Okuma. Several fires occurred in Chiba and Miyagi. At least 1,800 houses destroyed when a dam failed in Fukushima. Maximum acceleration of 2.93 g recorded at Tsukidate.

At the latitude of this earthquake, the Pacific plate moves approximately westwards with respect to the North America plate at a velocity of 83 mm/yr. The Pacific plate thrusts underneath Japan at the Japan Trench, and dips to the west beneath Eurasia. The location, depth, and focal mechanism of the March 11 earthquake are consistent with the event having occurred as thrust faulting associated with subduction along this plate boundary. Note that some authors divide this region into several microplates that together define the relative motions between the larger Pacific, North America and Eurasia plates; these include the Okhotsk and Amur microplates that are respectively part of North America and Eurasia.\r\n</p><p>The March 11 earthquake was preceded by a series of large foreshocks over the previous two days, beginning on March 9th with an M 7.2 event approximately 40 km from the March 11 earthquake, and continuing with a further 3 earthquakes greater than M 6 on the same day.\r\n</p><p>The Japan Trench subduction zone has hosted 9 events of magnitude 7 or greater since 1973. The largest of these was an M 7.8 earthquake approximately 260 km to the north of the March 11 event, in December 1994, which caused 3 fatalities and almost 700 injuries.

More than 1,000 villages in the area were affected by the earthquakes, Ahmad Reza Shaji&#39;i, a Red Crescent official, told the Iranian Students&#39; News Agency (ISNA). Some 130 villages suffered more than 70 percent damage, and 20 villages were completely destroyed, he said. &#34;We saw some villages that were truly destroyed,&#34; said Sadati, the photographer who was documenting the quake aftermath. &#34;One good thing was that the earthquake happened during the day, so many people were not in their homes. If it had happened at night the casualties would have been far worse.&#34; Close to 300 people were believed to be dead, said Reza Sadighi, Ahar&#39;s local governor, Fars news agency said. National emergency head Gholam Reza Masoumi said 5,000 people are believed to be injured, according to ISNA... Homes and business premises in Iranian villages, however, are often made of concrete blocks or mud brick that can crumble and collapse in a strong quake. Water, electricity, and phone lines in the area of Varzaghan are all down, further hindering rescue efforts, Iran&#39;s English-language Press TV reported. (reference #9933)</p>",

Malalas mentions that during the reign of Hadrian, Cyzicus, which was the great capital\r\ncity of the province of Hellespont, suffered an earthquake on the night of 10 November. He gave generously to the city and restored it. Prom the Sibylline Oracles, it comes out that the earthquake in Cyzicus was associated by a seismic sea wave. Eusebios mentions that during this earthquake, Nicomedia collapsed in ruins and many parts of the city of Nicea were destroyed. Hadrian gave generously for their restoration. In the Chronicon Paschale it is written that most of Nicomedia and Aoria in Bithynia collapsed in an earthquake. Prom an inscription found on a stele in Nicomedia, it comes out that two young children and the man in charge of them were killed by the earthquake (Georgiades, 1904; Guidoboni et al, 1994). (reference #4408)\r\n</p><p>121. Nicomedea. About 121 AD a major earthquake in Bithynia destroyed its capital Nicomedea as well as the greater part of Nicaea, and probably Aoria, resulting in loss of life. Nicomedea and Nicaea were rebuilt out of public funds. The fortifications of both cities were also rebuilt by the state with strong walls, which suggests that the old walls were destroyed by the earthquake. The funerary inscription of the death of people in this earthquake and the minting of coins to commemorate the reconstruction of Nicomedea suggest the importance of the event. The date of this earthquake is not certain. Probably it took place in the fifth year of Hadrian, which began in August AD 121, but definitely before Hadrian visited Asia Minor in AD 124... Hadrian contributed to the construction of the new agorae and fora both in Nicomedea and in Nicaea and rebuilt fortifications in Bithynia, an indication that damage extended to other parts of Bithynia away from the capital. A mint of Roman coins at the time celebrated Hadrian as the &#39;Restituor Nicomediae&#39;. It is quite possibe that a funerary inscription from Nicomedea is connected with this event, since it commemorates the death of two children and a slave in an earthquake and dates from about this time.. Guidoboni (1989) amalgamates this event with the earthquake of 123 Cyzicus, adds a sea wave and dates it to 120-128. (reference #9116)</p>",

The Philippine Sea plate is unusual in that its borders are nearly all zones of plate convergence. The Pacific plate is subducted into the mantle, south of Japan, beneath the Izu-Bonin and Mariana island arcs, which extend more than 3,000 km along the eastern margin of the Philippine Sea plate. This subduction zone is characterized by rapid plate convergence and high-level seismicity extending to depths of over 600 km. In spite of this extensive zone of plate convergence, the plate interface has been associated with few great (M&gt;8.0) \u0091megathrust&#39; earthquakes. This low seismic energy release is thought to result from weak coupling along the plate interface (Scholz and Campos, 1995). These convergent plate margins are also associated with unusual zones of back-arc extension (along with resulting seismic activity) that decouple the volcanic island arcs from the remainder of the Philippine Sea Plate (Karig et al., 1978; Klaus et al., 1992).\r\n</p><p>South of the Mariana arc, the Pacific plate is subducted beneath the Yap Islands along the Yap trench. The long zone of Pacific plate subduction at the eastern margin of the Philippine Sea Plate is responsible for the generation of the deep Izu-Bonin, Mariana, and Yap trenches as well as parallel chains of islands and volcanoes, typical of circum-pacific island arcs. Similarly, the northwestern margin of the Philippine Sea plate is subducting beneath the Eurasia plate along a convergent zone, extending from southern Honshu to the northeastern coast of Taiwan, manifested by the Ryukyu Islands and the Nansei-Shoto (Ryukyu) trench. The Ryukyu Subduction Zone is associated with a similar zone of back-arc extension, the Okinawa Trough. At Taiwan, the plate boundary is characterized by a zone of arc-continent collision, whereby the northern end of the Luzon island arc is colliding with the buoyant crust of the Eurasia continental margin offshore China. \r\n</p><p>Along its western margin, the Philippine Sea plate is associated with a zone of oblique convergence with the Sunda Plate. This highly active convergent plate boundary extends along both sides the Philippine Islands, from Luzon in the north to the Celebes Islands in the south. The tectonic setting of the Philippines is unusual in several respects: it is characterized by opposite-facing subduction systems on its east and west sides; the archipelago is cut by a major transform fault, the Philippine Fault; and the arc complex itself is marked by active volcanism, faulting, and high seismic activity. Subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate occurs at the eastern margin of the archipelago along the Philippine Trench and its northern extension, the East Luzon Trough. \r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p> In Mountain Ali in the southern part of the island, a man was killed by a rockslide while driving a car on a mountain road, the Taiwan Fire Agency said... Another man was killed by a falling rock when he was working at a farm in Chushan, near the epicenter. Rockslides at a scenic mountainous area near the epicenter injured several people, the agency said. In all, 21 people were injured by the earthquake, many by fallen objects. (reference #10564)</p>",

The earthquake struck several hundred kilometers to the east of the Sunda-Java Trench, which is the seafloor expression of the plate boundary between Sunda and the Indo-Australia tectonic plates. The location and faulting mechanism of this earthquake are consistent with upper plate accommodation of the right-lateral component of oblique convergence between the two plates, which is most clearly expressed along the Sumatran Fault, a major transform structure that bisects the island of Sumatra and whose main strand lies further to the west of the July 2 earthquake. At the latitude of this event, the Indo-Australia plate moves towards the northeast with respect to Sunda at a rate of approximately 60 mm/yr.\r\n</p><p>While earthquake activity in the region is more frequently associated with thrust faulting along the subduction zone to the west of the July 2 earthquake, upper plate events in Sumatra have not been uncommon; half a dozen M6&#43; earthquakes have occurred within 250 km of the July 2 event over the past 40 years. Such earthquakes can be very hazardous if close to population centers - as the July 2 event was - because of their shallow depths. A M 6.7 earthquake in November 1990, 120 km to the southeast, resulted in approximately 7 fatalities.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>Jakarta (ANTARA News) - The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) on Sunday reported that the death toll of the earthquake in Aceh had increased to 40 from 30 as previously reported on Thursday. Spokesperson of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho on an official statement on the agency website said that as many as 2,362 people were injured, 63 were heavily injured while the other 22,125 were displaced due to the earthquake. The magnitude 6.2 earthquake cast damage to over 15,919 residential houses and 623 public buildings. Central Aceh District becomes the most affected by the earthquake with 31 dead casualties, four residents missing, and the other 19,879 were displaced and taking refuge to 70 camps spread across the district. As many as 232 out of 352 villages in the district suffered the most damage by the earthquake. The earthquake damaged 13,862 resident houses; 5,516 with heavy damage, 2,750 suffered medium damage, and 5,596 with minor damage, and also 547 public buildings such as health center buildings, schools, and administration buildings. Meanwhile in Bener Meriah District, there are only eight of 233 villages directly affected by the earthquake. The Agency reported nine resident were dead, 23 injured and 2,265 displaced due to the earthquake. There refugees needed more supply of tents and blanket as they were evacuated to makeshift camps in mountainous area in which the temperature hit 14 degree Celsius at night, Nugroho said. The earthquake cast damage to 2,057 resident houses; 662 were heavily damaged, 311 with medium damage and 1,184 with minor damage, and 76 public facilities. (reference #10658)</p>",

A tsunami with amplitude 25 cm was recorded on a Deep Ocean Gauge off Esmeraldas, Ecuador. It was also recorded on tide gauges at La Libertad and on Isla Santa Cruz with amplitudes above sea level of 14 cm and 10 cm respectively.\r\n<p>The April 16, 2016 M 7.8 earthquake, offshore of the west coast of northern Ecuador, occurred as the result of shallow thrust faulting on or near the plate boundary between the Nazca and South America plates. At the location of the earthquake, the Nazca plate subducts eastward beneath the South America plate at a velocity of 61 mm/yr. The location and mechanism of the earthquake are consistent with slip on the primary plate boundary interface, or megathrust, between these two major plates. Subduction along the Ecuador Trench to the west of Ecuador, and the Peru-Chile Trench further south, has led to uplift of the Andes mountain range and has produced some of the largest earthquakes in the world, including the largest earthquake on record, the 1960 M 9.5 earthquake in southern Chile. While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as slip over a larger fault area. Events of the size of the April 16, 2016 earthquake are typically about 160x60 km in size (length x width). Ecuador has a history of large subduction zone related earthquakes. Seven magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes have occurred within 250 km of this event since 1900. On May 14th, 1942, a M 7.8 earthquake occurred 43 km south of this April 16th, 2016 event. On January 31st, 1906 a M 8.3 earthquake (reportedly as large as M 8.8 in some sources) nucleated on the subduction zone interface 90 km to the northeast of the April 2016 event, and ruptured over a length of approximately 400-500 km, resulting in a damaging tsunami that caused in the region of 500-1,500 fatalities. The April 2016 earthquake is at the southern end of the approximate rupture area of the 1906 event. A shallow, upper crustal M 7.2 earthquake 240 km east of the April 2016 event on March 6th, 1987 resulted in approximately 1,000 fatalities. (reference #1053)\r\n</p><p>663 fatalities. 9 missing.

The city of Kaikoura was cut off by road due to landslides, road subsidence and damage to bridges and other infrastructure. Widespread damage to buildings and docks and power outages occurred in Wellington. Preliminary studies by GNS Science, New Zealand, indicate that surface faulting was observed on at least 12 faults, with a maximum uplift of about 10 m and about 110 km of coastal uplift was observed in Marlborough and northern Canterbury. Felt (VIII) at Amberley, (VII) at Blenheim and (VI) at Brightwater, Carterton, Kapiti, Lower Hutt, Lyttelton, Nelson, Porirua, Rangiora, Richmond, Wanganui and Wellington. Felt in most of New Zealand, from Northland and Gisborne to Southland.<p><b>Tectonic Summary</b></p><p>The November 13, 2016 M 7.8 earthquake in North Canterbury, New Zealand, occurred as the result of shallow oblique-reverse faulting on or near the boundary between the Pacific and Australia plates in South Island, New Zealand. At the location of this earthquake, the Pacific plate moves to the west-southwest with respect to the Australia plate at a rate of approximately 40 mm/yr. The epicenter of the earthquake is about 30-45 km south-southeast of the main surface expression of the plate boundary in the region-the Hope Fault, part of the Marlborough Fault system that connects a subduction zone to the primary plate boundary in the South Island-the Alpine Fault. The plate boundary in the region of the earthquake is complex, involving a transition from subduction along the Hikurangi Trough to the east of the North Island, to transform faulting through the South Island. The size, depth (~25 km) and faulting orientation of the November 13 event suggest a larger, subduction-related structure, though the subduction zone interface is not thought to extend this far to the south of the Alpine fault system. The complexity of the event, involving a main energy release delayed by about 40 s, combined with an early aftershock distribution extending about 150 km to the north-northeast of the mainshock, suggests the potential for triggered slip on the Pacific:Australia subduction zone interface.</p><p>The November 13th M 7.8 earthquake is the largest event in the region since an M 7.3 earthquake 100 km to the northwest in June 1929. </p><p>(above from ref#1053)</p><p>Prime Minister confirmed two fatalities on Monday, one in Kaikoura and one in Mt Lyford.

        "comments": "The September 19, 2017, M 7.1 earthquake in Central Mexico occurred as the result of normal faulting at a depth of approximately 50 km. Focal mechanism solutions indicate that the earthquake occurred on a moderately dipping fault, striking either to the southeast, or to the northwest. The event is near, but not directly on, the plate boundary between the Cocos and North America plates in the region. At the location of this event, the Cocos plate converges with North America at a rate of approximately 76 mm/yr, in a northeast direction. The Cocos plate begins its subduction beneath Central America at the Middle America Trench, about 300 km to the southwest of this earthquake. The location, depth, and normal-faulting mechanism of this earthquake indicate that it is likely an intraplate event, within the subducting Cocos slab, rather than on the shallower megathrust plate boundary interface.

        "comments": "The August 21, 2018, M 7.3 earthquake near the northern coast of Venezuela occurred as the result of oblique reverse faulting at intermediate depth. The focal mechanism solution indicates slip occurred on either a steep fault striking east-west, or on a shallow structure striking southeast. At the location of the earthquake, the South America plate moves westward with respect to the Caribbean plate at a rate of approximately 20 mm/yr. The South America plate begins its subduction beneath the Caribbean plate about 550 km to the east of today&#39;s earthquake and reaches depths close to 150 km in the vicinity of this event. This earthquake occurred near the southern end of the Caribbean subduction zone. At shallow depth, the plate boundary in this region transitions to transform faulting along the San Sebastian - El Pilar fault system. The depth and focal mechanism solution of today&#39;s earthquake is consistent with faulting at depth, within subducted lithosphere of the South America plate, rather than along the shallow right-lateral transform plate boundary.\r\n<p>While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as slip over a larger fault area. Oblique-thrust-faulting events of the size of the August 21st, 2018 earthquake are typically about 65x25 km (length x width).\r\n</p><p>Earthquakes like this event, with focal depths between 70 and 300 km, are commonly termed &#34;intermediate-depth&#34; earthquakes. Intermediate-depth earthquakes represent deformation within subducted lithosphere rather than at the shallow plate interfaces between subducting and overriding tectonic plates. They typically cause less damage on the ground surface above their foci than is the case with similar-magnitude shallow-focus earthquakes, but large intermediate-depth earthquakes may be felt at great distance from their epicenters. Earthquakes have been reliably located to depths close to 180 km in this region.\r\n</p><p>While there have been 17 previous M 6&#43; earthquakes in this region, large earthquakes are rare; this is the largest historic event within 250 km of this location in the 20th and 21st centuries.

Preliminary focal mechanism solutions for the earthquake indicate faulting occurred as the result of either left lateral slip on a near-vertical plane striking west-southwest, or as right-lateral slip on a near-vertical plane striking north-northwest. Slip on the left-lateral plane would be consistent with the orientation of regional faults, and the local plate boundary. At the location of this event, the Arabia plate moves towards the north-northwest with respect to Eurasia at a rate of about 21 mm/yr. The Anatolia Block moves approximately towards the west with respect to both plates, creating right-lateral motion between Anatolia and Eurasia along the North Anatolian Fault in northern Turkey, and left-lateral motion between Anatolia and Arabia along the East Anatolian Fault in southeastern Turkey. The January 24 earthquake is located on or close to the East Anatolian Fault.</p><p>Turkey is a tectonically active country, and regularly experiences damaging earthquakes. Within 250 km of the January 24, 2020 earthquake, seven other M6 or larger events have occurred over the preceding half century. Several of these have been destructive; a M6.1 earthquake in May 1986, about 120 km to the west of this earthquake, killed 15 and damaged over 4,000 houses. A M 6.4 in May 2003, 140 km to the northeast of today&#39;s event killed 177 people, injured hundreds, and destroyed over 700 buildings. In March, 2010, a M6.1 earthquake 100 km to the northeast killed 42, injured 100, and destroyed close to 300 buildings. In September 1975, a M 6.7 event (the 1975 Lice earthquake) about 140 km to the east of today&#39;s earthquake killed more than 2,000 people and caused significant local damage. In May 1971, a M 6.9 event (the 1971 Bing\u00f6l earthquake) 150 km to the northeast of the January 2020 earthquake killed 65 and also caused significant damage. Farther back in time, the East Anatolian Fault has a history of large earthquakes. Preliminary locations for the January 24, 2020 event place it near a location of East Anatolian Fault that has no documented large rupture since an earthquake in 1875.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12615, 12619:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>The quake also injured over 1,600 people but at least 45 survivors have been pulled alive from the rubble so far, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told a news conference Sunday in Istanbul.\r\n</p><p>The agency said 76 buildings were destroyed and more than 1,000 were damaged by the quake.\r\n</p><p>Turkish emergency teams on Monday recovered the bodies of the last two missing quake victims from the rubble of a collapsed building, raising the death toll from the powerful tremor that hit eastern Turkey to 41.</p>",

Towers, including that of the Proavlaka monastery, collapsed, and churches and walls cracked open: the cupola of the monastery of Megali Lavra&#39;s katholikon fell down, as did the dome and altar of the nosokomeion. <b>Deaths resulted from this damage.</b> The earthquake seems to have generated a seismic sea wave, which flooded the harbour area.\r\n</p><p><b>This earthquake took place at the fourth hour of the day, Friday, on St Leontius Day, 18 June a.M. 7093 </b>(1585 O.S.; Lampros 1909a, 211; Lampros 1910a, 177; Millet et al. 1904, 128), or, according to others, on 18 July (Stojanovic 1902, 234).\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #12677:</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>This is the case of the 18 [O.S.]/<b>28[N.S.] June 1585</b> earthquake which is mentioned in various documentary sources reviewed by [reference #9116].</p>",
