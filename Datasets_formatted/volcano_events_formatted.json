Interior and Justice Minister Fabio Valencia Cossio told reporters that the first report of the eruption said that &#34;10 people died&#34; and that it has been impossible to establish &#34;whether there have been other tragic events.&#34; The official said that the natural phenomenon chiefly affected the indigenous reservations located between the municipalities of Inza and Balalcazar. The authorities have been unable to reach the highest parts of the volcano - located 285 kilometers (177 miles) southwest of Bogota - because bad weather has kept helicopters carrying supplies out of the area and the roads were obliterated by avalanches that occurred at the time of Thursday night&#39;s eruption. The eruption of the Nevado del Huila volcano on Thursday night formed a crater approximately 400 meters (1,300 feet) in diameter on one of the peaks of this mountain range in southwestern Colombia. The volcano is located in the central Andean range of Colombia, in a region where the provinces of Huila, Tolima and Cauca come together. The Bellavista stream, a tributary of the Paez River, was covered by the avalanche sparked by the interaction of the emerging hot lava with the layer of glacial ice.",

In 338 Saka (that is, 416), a thunderous roar was heard from the bowels of Mount Ratuwara (also called Pulosari, an extinct volcano in the Banten region, the closest to the Sunda strait). This roar was answered by an identical roar from the bowels of Mount Kapi, which is situated west of the modern [region?] of Eanten. An enormous blinding flame, which reached the heavens, exploded from Kapi* Mountain. The whole world shook, Thunder pealed out, a storm burst, and it began to rain. However, the eruption of flame from Mount Kapi not only did not diminish with the rain , but even increased, The roar was terrifying. In the end, Mount Kapi exploded into pieces with a terrific noise and descended into the depths of the earth. A sea wave arose and inundated the land... After the water receded, Mount Kapi and its locality were left on the sea bottom, while Java Island split into two parts. Thus the islands of Sumatra and Java were separated. [The events are very similar to the famous eruption of Krakatau in 1883. It is possible that Mount Kapi is in fact the Krakatau Volcano.] \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2771:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>According to ancient Japanese scriptures, the first known supercolossal eruption of Krakatau occurred in the year 416 A. D. - Some have reported it to occur in 535 A.D. The energy of this eruption is estimated to have been about 400 megatons of TNT, or the equivalent of 20,000 Hiroshima bombs. This violent early eruption destroyed the volcano,\r\nwhich collapsed and created a 7 km wide submarine caldera. The remnants of this earlier violent volcanic explosion were the three islands of Krakatau, Verlaten and Lang (Rakata, Panjang, and Sertung). Undoubtedly the 416 A.D. eruption/explosion/collapse generated a series of catastrophic tsunamis, which must have been much greater than those generated in 1883. The time of tsunami with wave height of several meters that affected Tamilnadu in\r\nIndia matches with this early Krakatau eruption. However, there are no other records to document the size of these early tsunamis or the destruction they caused. Subsequent to the 416 A.D. eruption and prior to 1883, three volcanic cones of Krakatau and at least one older caldera had combined again to form the island of Rakata. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2432:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>The renowned volcano Krakatau (frequently misstated as Krakatoa) lies in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra. Collapse of the ancestral Krakatau edifice, perhaps in 416 AD, formed a 7-km-wide caldera. Remnants of this ancestral volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently Rakata, Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island.</p>",

The towns of Palmer, San Felipe, Coombia, and Centepee, are all ruined. Ashes are 7 ft. deep in the tineas and towns. Mud, stones, and lava have fallen all over the country. Houses have been crushed by the weight of the volcanic material that has fallen upon them. Retalhuleu, Mazatenango, and Quezaltenango have not suffered so much, but this calamity is only beginning. We have mud and ashes in Retalhuleu. There is great loss of life. Cattle and horses are dead by thousands. Famine and pest are approaching. God help us! Bridges and roads have been destroyed. It is impossible to get further news.\r\n</p><p>LIVES REPORTED LOST.<br />It is the common belief in all the coast towns of Central America that thousands of lives have been sacrificed in this awful disaster. Those who have come in from the region immediate to the zone of devastation insist that all who were in the towns of Pilmar, San Felipe, Colombia, and Coatepee must have perished. </p><p>LOSS REACHES MILLIONS.<br />The property losses are enormous. The estimates of these losses are in varying millions. The coffee fincas of the Western Department of Guatemala were among the most productive and profitable in the world. On October 31 advices were received in this city to the effect that the entire coffee zone of Guatemala had been destroyed, and that the lives of all engaged on the fincas and living in the towns and villages were in imminent danger. Later information not only confirms these first reports, but greatly enlarges the area of destruction and vastly increases the amount of loss to the coffee planters. </p><p>AN OFFICIAL REPORT.<br />Mr. James C. McNally, United States Consul-General at Guatemala City, in his official report to the State Department, estimates the total loss at more than \u00a31,000,000. He says ; \u0097 &#34;As a climax to the terrible earthquakes of April 18, which practically compassed the ruin of Quezaltenango, the volcano Santa Maria, almost adjoining that city, erupted on October 24, throwing out quantities of mud and ashes, causing untold damage on the coast side, which comprises the rich coffee zone of Guatemala. The volcano is still active, and ashes are falling on places 30 miles distant from the crater.&#34; </p><p>FIFTEEN THOUSAND PERSONS DEAD.<br />Mr. Hans Lang left here six weeks ago to assume the position of assistant manager of the plantation of Lucerno, near Osuna. In speaking of the loss of life resulting from the eruption, Mr. Lang said:--&#34;In Guatemala City it was estimated that 15,000 lives were lost. The exact number will never be known, as thousands lie buried beneath the ashes, and their bodies will never be recovered. I was stationed fifty miles from Santa Maria, and no ashes fell on my plantation, although the rumblings were distinctly heard and the lightning flashes plainly seen. When the volcano of Fuego, adjacent to the plantation, began to belch forth smoke, I thought it time to decamp, so I made my way to Guatemala City.</p></i></i>",

The aerosol has the effect of reducing solar heat reaching the surface of the planet, leading to global cooling. Strange atmospheric phenomena had been observed in Europe before the summer of 1816. In May 1815 the sunsets in England were exceptionally colorful, and by September the sky seemed to be on fire every evening. But the spectacular skies brought bad weather the following year, and the year 1816 is the worst on record in Europe, with the mean temperature about 3 deg C below average across the entire continent from Britain in the north to Tunisia in the south. In England the summer was miserable, with the mean temperature for June the lowest on record, or 12.9 deg C. In France it was so cold that the wine harvest was later than at any time since record keeping began--delayed until November in those districts where the grapes were not already frozen on the vine. In Germany crops failed, a situation exacerbated by the war with Napoleon, and famine and price inflation were widespread. Conditions in Germany became so intolerable that people in many districts rioted and set off in search of better living conditions, starting the great migration from northern Europe east to Russia and west to America. The severe weather in fact led to crop failure of all the major crops in Europe and doubling of the price of wheat from 1815 to 1817. When we consider than in the early part of the 19th century agriculture was the mainstay of society, it is clear that the climate change had a strong impact on the economy of the western world. </p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2432:</i></blockquote> <p>VEI 7, Tephra Volume: 1.6x 10<sup>11</sup> m<sup>3</sup>. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #9675</i></blockquote> \r\nApproximately 11,000 direct deaths from bomb impacts, tephra falls, and tsunamis; recent work indicates pyroclastic flows reached all but W coast and probably caused most direct fatalities on Sumbawa.\r\n<p>Indirect effects: An estimated 49,000 persons died of famine and disease on Sumbawa and Lombok islands following the eruption.

        "comments": "One account says nearby townspeople fled during frequent earthquake activity, so there were very few victims even though destruction reached Catarman. Another says very considerable number of victims. (reference #9675)\r\n<p>In the first months of this year [1871], about February 16, earthquakes became very frequent; shortly after\r\nthe inhabitants of Mambajao and Catarman became convinced that the radiating center of the seismic disturbance was located in their little island, and not very far distant in the same mountain, whose fertile side, covered with verdure, had never been suspected of harboring a dangerous enemy... \r\n</p><p>On the 21st [Feb] at 4 o\u0092clock a. m. a violent earthquake shook the island, causing considerable\r\ndamage to the stone buildings. On the flank of the mountain the sight was dreadful. The rolling masses of stone were destroying trees and plantations, while the opening\r\nof fissures caused a noise like that of a great storm. The inhabitants of the town were terrified and from this moment began to escape in their boats to the neighboring\r\ncoasts of Mindanao and Bohol in search of safety...\r\n</p><p>During the months of March and April earthquakes succeeded one another with the same frequency and\r\nwere accompanied by effects identical with those just described... The inhabitants of the towns in the neighborhood of Mt. Catarman, with the exception of a few of the bolder spirits and some of the very poor, fled from their houses. Hence it is that when the eruption actually took place it found very few victims. \r\n</p><p>At last the shocks suddenly ceased. When day broke on April 30, at the foot of Mt. Catarman, which had been so shaken by the preceding earthquakes that it exposed its skeleton through the landslides and fissures, a column of thick vapor was seen rising up into the sky near the sea and about 400 yards distant from the town of Catarman. This column of vapor disappeared completely some hours afterwards. </p><p>At about 7 p. m. of the same day a tremendous explosion was heard in the direction of the above-mentioned spot, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke, which came from the same place. Everything roundabout\r\nwas set on fire. At the same time a shower of stones, earth, and ashes was vomited forth from the recently made openings. The ashes rose to a considerable height, spreading out and reaching Cebu and other islands 110 miles away. Within a radius of 2 miles from the new crater the destruction caused by the shower of fire, stones, earth,\r\nand ashes was almost complete; but fortunately there is no report of many human victims, evidently because the inhabitants of Catarman, which the destruction reached, had fled in due time to safer quarters. The eruption continued for six or seven days, after which the paroxysm died down, but the silent flowing of the semifluid lava continued,\r\nbuilding up a rough cone, which in two or three weeks&#39; time\r\nmeasured some eight feet in height...\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2070)</p>",

The first shocks appear to have occurred in the night of the 8th of last month, and they increased until they became so violent that the white inhabitants fled from their dwellings and the natives hid themselves in the bush. The shocks were very severe on Ambrym, Pentecost and Espritu Santo. So far as could be learnt no loss of life had taken place, but on the coast station dwellings were shaken to pieces. The earthquake was due to an eruption of a volcano near Epi. Describing that outburst, a passenger by the steamer La Parouse said: &#34;Immense vomiting jets of smoke and flame went skyward. The spectacle as viewed from the deck of the La Parouse was impressively grand.&#34; The eruption was followed by a tidal wave, which did infinitely greater damage to the plantations than the eruption.

        "comments": "<blockquote>Reference #9675</blockquote>\r\n4 were killed and 4 injured prior to the catastrophic June 15-16 eruptions that killed several hundred. By Aug 20, mudflows had killed more than 100. Disease at evacuation camps had (by Sept 20) brought the total fatalities to about 800. \r\n<blockquote>Reference #2432</blockquote>\r\nPrior to 1991 Pinatubo volcano was a relatively unknown, heavily forested lava dome complex located 100 km NW of Manila with no records of historical eruptions. The 1991 eruption, one of the world&#39;s largest of the 20th century, ejected massive amounts of tephra and produced voluminous pyroclastic flows, forming a small, 2.5-km-wide summit caldera whose floor is now covered by a lake. Caldera formation lowered the height of the summit from 1745 to 1486 m. Although the eruption caused hundreds of fatalities and major damage with severe social and economic impact, successful monitoring efforts greatly reduced the number of fatalities. Widespread lahars that redistributed products of the 1991 eruption have continued to cause severe disruption.\r\n<p>March 1991. The press reported that an explosion on 2 April deposited ash over an area of about 10,000 m2, including part of one village, and that about 2,000 people were evacuated. No injuries or deaths were reported. PHIVOLCS confirmed the explosion, and later noted a SW-NE-trending line of new vents extending 0.5-1.0 km on the N side of the volcano. The vents continued to emit a gas plume 200-500 m high as of mid-April. Observers at Clark Air Force Base (~15 km E) reported sulfurous odors. A seismic net, installed following the 2 April explosion, recorded increasing seismicity, reaching 135 earthquakes on 15 April.\r\n</p><p>April 1991. On 2 April, an explosion at the E end of Pinatubo&#39;s geothermal area (about 1.5 km NW of the summit and 2/3 of the way down the flank) ejected clouds of steam and minor quantities of ash to 500-800 m height. Ash fell 2 km away, primarily to the NW and SW, and covered an area of about 10,000 m2, including part of one village, from which about 2,000 people were evacuated. No injuries or deaths were reported. \r\n</p><p>May-June 1991. After more than 2 months of increasing seismicity, deformation, and emission of small plumes, a series of strong explosions culminated in one of the largest eruptions of this century. The 15-16 June climactic phase lasted more than 15 hours, sending tephra to 30 km altitude, generating voluminous pyroclastic flows, and leaving a small caldera in the former summit region. Ten days later, the aerosol cloud formed a nearly continuous band that stretched 11,000 km from Indonesia to Central Africa. Timely evacuations saved many lives, but the combined effects of the eruption and a typhoon killed more than 300 people.\r\n</p><blockquote>Reference #11546</blockquote>\r\nBy early June [1991], officials called for the evacuation of 25,000 people living in the area, including American service people at Clark Air Base and the U.S. Naval Station at Subic Bay. &#34;By June 14 the recommended evacuation radius was 30 kilometers, which would have applied to perhaps 400,000 people,&#34; Newhall said. Never before had such a widespread evacuation attempt been made before a volcanic eruption. By the time the volcano erupted on 15 June, scientists and public officials had convinced more than 65,000 people to evacuate. More than 350 died during the eruption, but USGS and PHIVOLCS estimate that evacuation efforts saved between 5000 and 20,000 lives.\r\n<blockquote>Reference #11542</blockquote>The eruption of Mt Pinatubo In June 1991 caused the largest perturbation this century to the particulate content of the stratosphere. The radiative influence of the injected particles put an end to several years of globally warm surface temperatures. At the same time, the combined\r\neffect of volcanic particles and anthropogenic reactive chlorine has led to record low levels of stratospheric ozone.",

At least 200 homes were destroyed, including 25 at Toribio and 15 at Piendamo. Moderate structural damage occurred at Bogota and Cali. An avalanche from the Huila Volcano blocked the Paez River causing severe flooding at Belalcazar and Neiva. Felt in much of west-central Colombia from Tunja to Pasto.

Although the preliminary epicenter determination was W of the volcano&#39;s summit, a more recent estimate places it on Nevado del Huila&#39;s SSW flank, several kilometers N of the village of Irlanda (figure 1; BGVN 19:5). Prior to the earthquake, normal background seismicity prevailed; a series of aftershocks also took place beneath the volcano. Earthquake damage was attributed to shaking, mass movement of loosened material, and flooding. The volcano&#39;s topography and volcanic deposits contributed to the disaster, but the primary area of landslides lay S of the main volcanic edifice and reached a maximum elevation of ~3,000 m. Aerial observers on 7 July saw no changes in either the vigor of fumaroles present near the summit or in the distribution and surface appearance of glaciers. Though dislodged ice was noted in news reports, none was found during fieldwork. The latest estimates on direct human impact from the earthquake are &gt;150 fatalities, 500 people listed as missing, and 20,000 people displaced. Six bridges and &gt;100 km of roads were destroyed.

The overflow of Maughan Lake, the crater lake at Parker volcano, followed heavy rains associated with a passing typhoon and caused flash flooding in NW-flank communities on 6 September. A team from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) was dispatched to determine whether the overflow was caused by volcanic activity. Although no volcanic alert was declared, PHIVOLCS recommended that the crater area should be considered off-limits because of instability of the crater walls. Fieldwork on 8-9 September revealed that the flood was channel-confined along the NW-flank Alah River, which drains the crater lake, from 1,000 m down to 540 m elevation (Barangay New Dumangas, T&#39;boli, South Cotabato Province).

        "comments": "Stromboli was hit by a set of violent eruptions Wednesday and the Mayor of Lipari, the biggest of the Aeolian Islands off Sicily that Stromboli belongs too, said one person was killed. Mayor Marco Giorgianni told ANSA that the victim was tourist who had trekked up to the summit of the volcano. The eruptions caused scared beach tourists to take to the sea. Two new lava spouts are creeping down the volcano on the famed island. The volcano is also shooting out red-hot rocks called lapilli which are setting fore to cane breaks, local sources said. &#34;A huge column of dense black smoke is coming out of the crater,&#34; an eye witness said. Another said &#34;there was a powerful explosion. We heard a bang, then a column of smoke and lapilli fell onto Ginostra, and flames on the slopes of the volcano&#34;. Fires have broken out across the island, fire services and forest rangers said. A journalist and owner of a bazar at Ginsotra, Gianluca Giuffre, told ANSA &#34;all the people who were in the village about a hundred tourists and residents, either holed up at home or threw themselves into the sea. (reference #12459)\r\n<p>Two pyroclastic flows were produced as a result of the explosions; they traveled down the Sciara and across the water for about 1 km before collapsing into the sea (figure 150). A hiker from Sicily was killed in the eruption and a Brazilian friend who was with him was badly injured, according to a Sicilian news source, ANSA, and the New York Post. They were hit by flying ejecta while hiking in the Punta dei Corvi area, due W of the summit and slightly N of Ginostra, about 100 m above sea level according to INGV. Most of the ejecta from the explosion dispersed to the WSW of the summit. Fallout also ignited vegetation on the slopes which narrowly missed destroying structures in the town.

A volcanologist at the monitoring post for Paluweh noted that the eruption lasted seven minutes, and that the pyroclastic flow burned trees around the beach and villages, making it difficult to reach the victims. Pyroclastic flows continued to be reported hours after the initial eruption. Based on analyses of satellite imagery and wind data, the Darwin VAAC reported that an ash plume rose to an altitude of 4.3 km (14,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted 130 km W.\r\n<p>\r\nNews sources noted that a mandatory evacuation order had caused some residents to evacuate prior to the eruption on 10 August, but nearly 10,000 still remained on the island. After the eruption, a rescue team was sent to evacuate about 2,000 people that remained inside a 3-km exclusion zone. A team member noted that rescuing people was difficult since they were reluctant to leave their livestock and homes, but also that the ground was hot and covered in 10-20 cm of ash. The VAAC reported that during 11-12 August ash plumes rose to an altitude of 1.8 km (6,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted 110-130 km W. A news article noted that the eruptions were smaller on 12 August, but pyroclastic flows continued to be observed. The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a scale of 0-4).</p>",

There was a weak underground shock which passed almost unnoticed, at Noumea (Port de France) in New Caledonia on the 15th at 19:30. There was a more perceptible shock on the 17th at 2O:00. It considerably disturbed the instruments at the astronomical observatory. The crosslines of the tubes of the transit instrument after the shock experienced spasmodic oscillations which were larger north-south than east-west. Then came news that the shocks may have been connected with an eruption of the volcano on Tanna Island. The news was delivered to the Vagap post office by a small English schooner, which had been situated near the volcano at the time of the eruptions. According to the captain, lava covered half the island, causing numerous victims among the population.</p>",

All 3,150 people in the path of these flows, on islands between Krakatau and Sumatra were killed; probably most by early tsunami but surely none survived the culminating eruption at 1000 on Aug 27.

Collapse of the ancestral Krakatau edifice, perhaps in 416 AD, formed a 7-km-wide caldera. Remnants of this ancestral volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently Rakata, Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island. Caldera collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes, and left only a remnant of Rakata volcano. This eruption, the 2nd largest in Indonesia during historical time, caused more than 36,000 fatalities, most as a result of devastating tsunamis that swept the adjacent coastlines of Sumatra and Java. Pyroclastic surges traveled 40 km across the Sunda Strait and reached the Sumatra coast. After a quiescence of less than a half century, the post-collapse cone of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former cones of Danan and Perbuwatan. Anak Krakatau has been the site of frequent eruptions since 1927.\r\n</p><p>Start date of eruption: 1883 May 20 \t\r\n</p><p>Stop date of eruption: 1883 Oct 21 (?)\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #9779:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>Krakatau (or Krakatoa), an island volcano lying in the Sunda Straits between Java and Sumatra at 6<sup>o</sup> S, erupted violently on August 26 and 27, 1883.

        "comments": "A rumbling volcano in western Indonesia on Saturday unleashed fresh clouds of searing gas that killed at least 14 people and injured three, only a day after villagers who fled earlier eruptions returned home thinking it was safe, officials said. The dead included four high school students on a school trip to see the volcano and a local journalist, said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. He said that the government on Friday allowed nearly 14,000 people living outside a three-mile danger zone to return home after the volcano&#39;s activity decreased. Mount Sinabung&#39;s morning eruption was followed by a more powerful blast that sent lava and pyroclastic flows down southern slopes up to 2.8 miles away, Nugroho said. Television footage showed villages, farms and trees around the 8,530-foot -high volcano covered in thick gray ash. Authorities were still preventing more than 16,000 villagers living along the path of hot clouds from going back to their homes, but many of them insisted on checking their houses and farms after more than four months of being crammed into temporary shelters. Authorities raised the alert status for Sinabung to the highest level in November.

Based on visual observations and measurements, the height of Mount Anak Krakatau, which was originally 338 meters, is currently only 110 meters. The volume of Mount Anak Krakatau decreased. The volume lost is estimated at 150-180 million cubic meters. The remaining volume currently ranges from 40-70 million cubic meters. The reduced body volume of Gunung Anak Krakarau is estimated because of the volcanic body creep process accompanied by high eruption rates from 24-27 / 12/2018.Observation of Gunung Anak Krakatau volcanic activity is still being monitored intensively by PVMBG. The status of Gunung Anak Krakatau remains at Standby level (Level III). It is recommended to the public not to approach Mount Anak Krakatau within a radius of 5 km from the crater because it is dangerous from throwing incandescent rocks, lava flows, hot clouds and heavy ash rain.

The helicopter departed from the Central Java\u0092s provincial capital of Semarang at 4 p.m. Basarnas operational director Maj. Gen.

BNPB reported that a major eruption occurred less than two hours later at 2250, followed by another large explosion at 2330. Ash plumes rose to an altitude of 17 km (55,800 ft) a.s.l. and caused ashfall in areas NE, NW, and W, as far as Pacitan (133 km WSW), Kulon Progo (236 km W), Temanggung (240 km WNW), and Banyuwangi (228 km E). Forty flights from the Juanda (81 km NE), Adi Sucipto Yogya (208 km W), and Adi Sumarmo Solo (175 km WNW) airports were cancelled. News articles reported that flights in and out of seven airports were cancelled or rerouted. Ashfall and tephra 5-8 cm in diameter caused structures to collapse, including schools, homes, and businesses. On 14 February BNPB reported that the eruption had <b>killed four people: one died due to a collapsing wall, one from ash inhalation, and two from &#34;shortness of breath&#34;</b>. All four victims lived within 7 km of Kelut in the regency of Malang, an area that received ashfall up to 20 cm thick. By 0600 the number of displaced people reached 100,248, but the report also noted that activity had declined. A report issued later that day noted that 76,388 people remained evacuated. Seismicity continued to decline and was at moderate levels during 15-17 February. An 18 February report noted that a total of <b>seven people in Malang had died</b>, and that the ashfall had affected cattle health and dairy production, farms, and the water supply.

(ref #1686)</p><p>On Aug 11, 1749, began one of the most violent outbursts of Taal on record. It has been described by Fr. Buencuchillo, 0. S. A,, an eye-witness, since he was at the time parish-priest of Sala. During the night of that day the top of the mountain burst out with tremendous force from the same crater which since ancient times used to emit fire and rocks. The course of events was this:</p><p>At about 11 o&#39;clock of the night I had noticed a rather extensive glare over the top of the island; but entirely unaware of what this might portent, I paid no special attention to it and retired to rest. Around 3 o&#39;clock in the morning of the 12th, I heard something like heavy artillery fire and began to count the reports, taking it for granted that they came from the ship which was expected to arrive from New Spain [Mexico] and which, according to an ancient custom, on entering Balayan Bay saluted Our Lady of Caysasay. I thought it strange, however, when I found that the number of detonations already exceeded one hundred, and still they did not cease. This caused me to rise with some anxiety as to what could be the matter; but my doubts were quickly dispelled, as at this moment there appeared four excited natives who shouted: &#34;Father, let us leave this place! The volcano has burst out and all this noise and racket comes from it!&#34;</p><p>By this time it began to dawn, and we saw the immense column of smoke which rose from the summit of the island, while several smaller whiffs issued from other openings. I confess that the spectacle, far from frightening me, rather delighted my eyes, especially when I noticed that also from the water there arose enormous columns of sand and ashes, which ascended in the shape of pyramids to marvelous heights and then fell back into the lake like illuminated fountains.</p><p>...During my flight I saw a great many tall trees, such as coconut and betel-nut palms, either miserably fallen, or so deeply buried that their tops were within reach of my hands. I likewise saw several houses which formerly, in accordance with Philippine custom, had their floors raised several yards above ground, but had sunk to such a degree that the same ladder which once served to ascend into them, was now used to descend to them. The most remarkable thing about this is that the natives tranquilly continue occupying them, though they find themselves buried alive.</p><p>It rained ashes in considerable quantity and that part of them which remained suspended in the air, formed a vast cloud which grew so dense as to cause real darkness during the hours of broad daylight.</p><p>Fr. Murillo states in his &#34;Geografia Historica, etc.,&#34; that he was at the time at the Sanctuary of Antipolo which lies 21 km almost due east from Manila. During the eruption he felt three or four earthquakes of such violence that the roof tiles of the tower were thrown to a distance of more than 10 meters. Of less intense shocks there were more than one hundred, and the earth trembled frequently during more than a year. There were likewise fierce thunderstorms during many days.</p><p>(above from ref #2340)</p>",

As Saderra Maso refers to 4 villages around lake being completely destroyed, these fatalities may refer only to those in Taal village. Permanent abandonment of several villages on lake shore. (reference #9675)</p><p>Of the eruption in 1754, the greatest recorded in the history of Taal Volcano, we have likewise a description from the pen of worthy Fr. Buencuchillo, at the time stationed at Taal, of which narrative the following is an abridgement:</p><p>On May 15, 1754, at about 9 or 10 o&#39;clock in the night, the volcano quite unexpectedly commenced to roar and emit, sky-high, formidable flames intermixed with glowing rocks which, falling back upon the island and rolling down the slopes of the mountain, created the impression of a large river of fire. During the following days there appeared in the lake a large quantity of pumice stone which had been ejected by the volcano. Part of these ejecta had also reached the hamlet of Bayuyungan and completely destroyed it.</p><p>The volcano continued thus until June 2, during the night of which the eruption reached such proportions that the falling ejecta made the entire island appear to be on fire, and it was even feared that the catastrophe might involve the shores of the lake. From the said 2d of June until September 25, the volcano never ceased to eject fire and mud of such bad character that the best ink does not cause so black a stain.</p><p>During the night of September 25, the fire emitted was quite extraordinary and accompanied by terrifying rumblings. The strangest thing was, that within the black column of smoke issuing from the volcano ever since June 2, there frequently formed thunderstorms, and it happened that the huge tempest cloud would scarcely ever disappear during two months.</p><p>At daybreak of September 26 we found ourselves forced to abandon our dwelling for fear lest the roofs come down upon us under the weight of ashes and stones which had fallen upon them during that hapless night. In fact, some weaker buildings collapsed. The depth of the layer of ashes and stones exceeded two &#34;cuartas&#34; [45 centimeters or 18 inches], and the result was that there was neither tree nor other plant which it did not ruin or crush, giving to the whole region an aspect as if a devastating conflagration had swept over it. After this the volcano calmed down considerably, though not sufficiently to offer any prospect of tranquility.</p><p><strong>Twelve persons are known to have perished</strong>-some carried away by the waves of the lake, others crushed beneath their collapsing houses. Thus the beautiful town of Taal remains a deserted wilderness and reduced to the utmost misery, while once it was one of the richest and most flourishing places. In the villages to the west of the lake, which were the greater and better part, all the houses have either collapsed under the load of material which had been piled upon them or have disappeared completely, swept away by the waves which in these places were so violent that they dug three ditches or channels, too wide and deed to be forded, and thus rendered impassable the road which joins the town with Balayan. In other parts of the lake shore have likewise opened many cracks and occurred very extensive slides. The worst of all is, that, the mouth of the river Pansipit having been blocked, the lake is rising and invading the towns of Lipa and Tanauan, both being on the lowest level, and inundating their buildings. All the animals of whatever kind have perished, some by being buried, others by drowning, the rest by starving, as not a green blade remained anywhere.</p><p>(above from reference #2340)</p>",

On Sangihe Is, after a sudden &#34;unbearable&#34; roar, the Awu Volcano began to erupt. Incandescent lava rushed down the slopes of the mountain with irresistible force, destroying everything in its path. Where the lava reached the shore, the sea water began to boil. Strong hot springs gushed up and the abundant surging boiling water destroyed and carried away everything that the fire had spared. \r\n</p><p>The sea surged onto the shore cliffs as during an underwater earthquake, and with a terrifying noise, it flooded the coast and &#34;snatched its victims from the fire.&#34;\r\n</p><p>An hour later, thunderous blows were heard, shaking the earth. A black column of ash and stones was ejected from the peak of the mountain. The column rose to the &#34;heavens&#34; and fell in a rain of fire on the slopes of the volcano, which were lit up by the red hot lava. Total darkness\r\nfell, in which one could not make out the closest objects; it was interrupted from time to time by outbreaks of light. Large bombs fell to the earth. The settlements and field s not destroyed by the lava were buried under a layer of ash and rocks. The flows rushed down from the mountain, and, encountering obstacles, spread out in lakes, which then became a new source of destruction.</p><p>All this took several hours. By midnight, all had quieted down, although the eruption began with new force the next noon. The ashfall continued all day and was so intensive that no light could penetrate, and almost total darkness set in.</p><p>A hurricane southeastern wind blew since the beginning of the eruption, and the ashes were carried as far as Mindanao Island. Later the wind blew from the north.</p><p>On March 17, there was a new eruption, in which fields and trees on the coast at Tabukan were destroyed. After this, the volcano quieted down, except that steam continuously rose from the numerous cracks and fractures. However, the lava flows were still so hot that one could not approach them. According to residents, the top of the volcano did not change noticeably in appearance.</p><p>At the main village of the island, Tahuna, several people were injured and homes were destroyed during the fall of ash and stones. Obstacles in the form of hills made the lava flow deviate from the village and turn to the sea in another place.</p><p>Along the flat slope between Tahuna and Kandhar, seven large lava flows descended to the sea, devastating this agricultural region. One of the flows passed through Kalongan village; only a few burned posts were left. Between Kalongan and Kandhar, a large area of the coast subsided below sea level. The mountain side had previously sloped gently to the very water line; after the eruption, it broke off as a steep wall about 60 m (200 feet) high.</p><p>The settlement of Kandhar, protected by this &#34;rib,&#34; suffered little: it was affected only by the fall of ashes and stones and the streams of hot water. In addition, before the eruption, the residents, fearing pirates, had hidden with their belongings in the thickets above the settlement, and did not suffer from the flooding.</p><p>The devastation was even greater on the coast from Kandhar to the northern tip of the island. Two tongues of lava thrust far into the sea to previous bottom marks of several metres (fathoms).</p><p>The number of victims was considerable: at Tahuna 722, at Kandhar 22, at Tabukan 2,039; total 2,806. For the most part, the people died in the gardens where they sought relief  from the heat. Those who attempted to run, were overtaken by flows of lava and water, perished under collapsing trees, were suffocated or were burned in the ashfall and the fires. At Kalongan and Tariang, the residents who took refuge in their houses died in the debris. Finally, those who took to the sea shore &#34;fell prey to vicious waves&#34;.</p>",

Serious earthquake shocks are reported as having occurred--writes the Malay Mail&#39;s Sumatra correspondent, in corroboration of a previous telegram--on the islands of Sangi and Talaut, in the residency of Menado. They originated from the volcano, Sahondaroemano, which has been inactive for some time. During the eruptions a huge landslip occurred on Endong mountain The mass measured 150 m in length, 100 in breadth, and was about 3 m in thickness. The kampong at Lesabe, in the Menaloe country was completely engulfed and 117 people were buried alive. The full extent of the damage resulting it is impossible to estimate. A tidal wave, 15 m high, passed over the coast and wrought much havoc. The Government school at Tamaho has been demolished as has the Palace of Raja Toboekan at Emawira. The shocks were of from 4 to 5 min duration. The steamship Flamingo has been sent with assistance from Tomini and is dealing out rice allowances to the destitute native population. A warship is on its way to the scene of the disaster, as many reports are coming to hand of damage done in other small islands near at hand. The Resident of Pasoerlan telegraphs that a shock has been experienced in Kampong Pabras, Probollingo. Five houses were destroyed and two people were buried in the debris. It has not yet been ascertained if they are alive or not.</p>",

Heiser, medical officer at time, estimates deaths at about 2,000. (reference #9675)\r\n<p>This increase in volcanic activity coincided with the  first microseismic movements registered in Manila at 20h20m of the 27th. It appears that the explosions began to assume a terrific violence at 1 o&#39;clock in the morning of the 30th. Shortly after 2 a.m. the volcano burst forth with frightful energy. A terrible roar which seemed to be at the same time subterraneous and in the air and could be heard in all directions from the volcano up to distances exceeding 500 km. At the same time there was seen an immense, threatening, black cloud, crossed by brilliant flashes of lightning and illumined by local explosions resembling globular lightning, the whole accompanied by peals of thunder for the space of half an hour. This tempestuous cloud must have risen to an enormous height, since it was observed from distances of some 400 km. \r\n</p><p>The chief feature of the eruption seems to have been a terrible explosion which with incredible violence hurled high up into the air and scattered in all directions glowing rocks, earth, mud, ashes, and gases. ..this death-dealing mixture mowed down or destroyed whatever it encountered in its path on the entire island and on the neighboring western shores of Lake Bombon. It cut down or uprooted trees and other plants, destroyed houses, and killed well-nigh every living being within a radius of 5 to 6 km to the east of the crater, and up to more than 15 km to the west thereof. \r\n</p><p>Of the 1,300 victims who perished in the 13 small barrios-some on Volcano Island itself, others on the western shore-many were killed in the act of fleeing; others were found buried underneath or among the debris of their huts which had been brought down upon them and torn to pieces, being partially covered with rocks and mud; some\r\nseem to have been killed by instantaneous asphyxiation, as they were found on their mats in the attitude of peaceful sleep.\r\n</p><p>An idea of the condition in which this region was left by the eruption is given by the report of Col. William C. Rivers, Philippines Constabulary. In this report, written February 5, it is estimated that the number of victims had then already reached 1,295. We quote from it the following passages: The worst stricken district comprises Volcano Island and west side of lake. All vegetation, including trees, destroyed. Country all covered with gray mud hardening under sun present-uniform ashen color. Mud flattened and covers all houses and objects.&#34;\r\n</p><p>After returning to Manila on the completion of his special mission, Colonel Rivers presented a final report in which the total number of dead is given as 1,335, that of the injured as 199. This report contains the further statement that 543 nipa houses have been destroyed and 702 head of cattle either drowned or otherwise lost owing to the eruption; the material losses, exclusive of ruined crops, are estimated at F130,159.</p><p>\r\nThe exact number of victims will probably never be known-first, because the waves have carried away many corpses and, no doubt, buried others beneath earth, trunks of\r\ntrees, and other debris, which filled up many depressions in the ground; secondly, because some have surely met their doom while fleeing toward the jungle, where their bones\r\nremained more or less completely buried by the volcanic ashes. Moreover, the number of people who inhabited these regions is by no means known accurately, as they were in the\r\nhabit of passing from one village to another according to their convenience in attending to their crops.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2340)\r\n</p><p>1911, Jan 30.

The eruption was reportedly characterized by a &#34;giant fireball&#34; and thick columns of smoke, as well as the ejection of lava and rocks. Two shepherd and hundreds of animals were buried by mud avalanches in the Huemules Valley.\r\n<p>Card 1645 (24 May 1973) Temperature rise, not eruption, caused damaging April lahar\r\n<br />\r\nThe following information was received by cable from Santiago on 24 May 1973. &#34;The last airplane reconnaisance flight on April 14 confirms that Mount Hudson has not been active since the 1971 eruption. Fumarolic activity in the central area of the 9-km-wide crater was observed. The ice cover melted last April producing a lahar which flowed down the Huemules and Cupquelan valleys destroying property, farmhouses, and cattle, finally reaching the sea 70 km away. A rise in temperature produced a 70% melting of the ice cover in the crater area.&#34;\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2432)</p>",

The Vanuatu Geohazards Department raised the alert level for the volcano last week after increased activity at Lombenben&#39;s Manaro Voui crater. Communities in the northwestern and southern parts of Ambae have been worst affected with reports of buildings and trees collapsing under the weight of the ash. Water supplies have also been contaminated and food gardens smothered. The operations manager of the National Disaster Management Office, Peter Korisa, said assessments were still be done and affected communities might be relocated. But he said a longer term solution was needed.

The population returned to their island on the 22 October 2017 after three weeks living in evacuation centres and camps. As of the 8 April, due to a change in wind direction, the North and some parts in the East of Ambae begun reporting heavy ash fall that they described as worse than any other ash fall in the past. Houses, other structures and trees have collapsed under the weight of the ash. Food gardens have been destroyed and water sources contaminated. Furthermore, large fallen trees have blocked road access to some communities in the North, while dangerous landslides believed to be linked to the heavy deposits of ashfall have since destroyed an entire village. The SOE also came with indication of the plan by the National government to assist with voluntary evacuations up until 30 April. After this, they will implement mandatory evacuations over a 2-week period until 15 May. (reference #12114)\r\n</p><p>Heavy rains on 30 March caused a large lahar that significantly damaged a village on the N side of the island. A high-altitude plume on 31 March was measured at 13.7 km altitude. Significant ashfall around the island caused infrastructure damage and health hazards to humans, livestock, and plants.

Five climbers who ascended the volcano in the early morning hours of 30 April were killed by the explosion later that day. On 2 May the climbers were found a few hundred meters below the NE crater rim. Their corpses, recovered by Civil Protection authorities, exhibited 3rd-degree burns and severe injuries caused by contusions. Climbing the volcano has been officially prohibited since the current eruption began, and signs were posted at Paso de Cortes. During a helicopter flight on 3 May a depression was observed on the surface of the new dome near the SE inner wall of the main crater. Streaks of gravel and boulders running down the NE outer slopes of the volcano were 10-20-m wide and a few hundred meters long, and very close to the route of ascent taken by most climbers.\r\n</p><p>(above from reference #2432)</p>",

The tephra covered most of the south Kanto plain, including Tokyo, and is found in deep sea cores in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Many lost their lives due to starvation after the eruption, however no victims were recorded as a direct result of the tephra fall-out. In Subashiri, 72 houses and 3 Buddhist temples were burned or crushed on the first day of the eruption. Following this eruption, many could not obtain food from their farms and thus died of starvation.\r\n\r\n<p>The eruption started forty-nine days after the devastating 1707 Hoei Earthquake (M8.4).</p>",

It covered a village of 10 homes; 31 people died. In the basalt sheets west of Waiohinu, a crack was formed, along which a horizontal shift occurred. Cracks also developed at other places. The earthquake was accompanied by countless recurrent shocks, at least 2000, of which some were also destructive. Several days after the earthquake, strong eruptions of the Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes occurred. Lava flows destroyed 37 homes. (reference #415)</p>",

The eruption of the Raluan Volcano lasted three days, during which time total darkness reigned; fishes and turtles died. The eruption of the Ghaie Volcano lasted three weeks. Due to the prevailing northwest winds, the ejecta settled mainly in the sea, and on land only the regions immediately adjoining the volcanoes suffered.

A tsunami was triggered by the sudden displacement of a large volume of seawater from the impact of a debris avalanche at the north shore of St. Augustine Island. This eruption and debris avalanche of St. Augustine Volcano in Cook Inlet, southcentral Alaska traveled ~5 km into the waters of the Cook Inlet. Half of the avalanche travel distance was beyond the pre-1883 shoreline, which was extended to 2 km. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #239:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>October 6, 1883, 19:04 GMT. Before the eruption on Augustine Island, <b>seven or eight Aleuts had landed to hunt otter during the winter...After the eruption, no trace could be found of the hunters.</b> \r\n</p><p>Augustine has had six significant eruptions: 1812, 1883-1884, 1935, 1963-1964, 1976, and 1986.

Modeling suggests that the waves traveled at speeds of up to 100 km/hr and generated by the debris avalanche was as much as 30 m high when generated at the leading edge of the debris avalanche and attenuated to heights of 7-9 m as the wave traveled toward the Kenai Peninsula and mainland Alaska. \r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2223:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>The waves inundated houses built along the beaches and carried away fishing boats. Thankfully, the tsunami occurred at low tide minimizing the impact in the Cook Inlet. It is possible that there may have been Aleut casualties during this event (a search for five or six Aleut hunters camped on Augustine Island just prior to the eruption yielded nothing) but the descriptions are unclear; the death designation here is conjectural.\r\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #4220:</i></blockquote> \r\n<p>October 6, 1883. An eyewitness account from English Bay notes minor ash fall occurred at the same time as the tsunami arrived. This ash fall cannot have been a product of the same eruption that generated the tsunami, as ash would have traveled more slowly than the tsunami wave. The minor ash fall at English Bay that began at about the same time as the tsunami lasted only ten minutes and is interpreted as having been generated by a small precursory eruption a few hours before the tsunamigenic events. There are additional accounts of a much larger ashfall starting at 11 am and lasting all day.</p>",

The cone of this volcano formed the island of the same name and had a height of 790 m above the water. The bulk of the volcanic structure flew into the air; only the eastern third of the cone remained in the form of a slope 120 m high, arc-shaped in plan, with steep inner and outer walls. In place of the part of the volcano which disappeared, depths formed with marks of more than 100 m.

(2001), consequently, it strongly supports that the eruptive date of Ilopango Caldera occurred in the period from the mid-4th to the mid-6th century. (reference #9745)</p>",

        "comments": "Indonesia&#39;s most active volcano, Mount Merapi, has killed over 320 people in a series of eruptions that started on October 26. The first phase of the eruption occurred on Tuesday, October 26, 2010 at 17:00 killing at least 36 people. The eruption was characterized by explosions along with pyroclastic flows that traveled WSW and SE. CVGHM reported that multiple pyroclastic flows occurred until 1854, when the pyroclastic flow activity started to subside. Most of the pyroclastic flows lasted 2 to 9 minutes, except for two that lasted 33 minutes each. The eruption was preceded by an increase in volcanic earthquakes and authorities had been encouraging evacuations, but many remained. The deaths included a 2 month old baby and the volcano&#39;s spiritual leader.\r\nBetween Thursday, November 4 and Friday, Nov 5 the volcano erupted killing over 280 people. Dozens are being treated for burns and respiratory problems after a gas cloud hit villages with even greater force than the previous eruptions. Over 300,000 people have been evacuated from the area. As many as 427 victims of the eruption were still treated at hospitals.\r\n<p>The eruption has directly affected the rural area and claimed 367 human fatalities, 277 injured, 410,388 evacuated as well as the damaged of infrastructures, houses, live stocks and agriculture areas. The volcanic ash spewed few kilometers above the summit and wind blows the ash endangered the cities and aviation. During the peak of crisis the Airport of Yogyakarta was closed. (reference #11801)\r\n</p><p>Loss is estimated at over 600 million US dollars. A large portion of the loss is related to forest devastation which consisted of 1.12 million ruined trees in 2,800 hectares of forest areas, loses in tourism, and damage to fruit plantations.

There was an eruption of the Raluan and\r\nTawurwur Volcanoes in Blanche Bay. The eruption was accompanied at different stages by oscillations of the water level in the bay.</p><p>The first strong earthquake struck on May 28 at about 13:20. It lasted half a minute and reached a force of 7 degrees (VIII Rossi-Forel)... On May 29, at about 5:30, a new shock was felt at Rabaul... Between 8:00 and 9:00, an elevation of Kaluan Is was observed... \r\n</p><p>The eruption of the volcano began at 16:15 [May 29]. The island and the adjacent sections of bottom began to rise quickly; the little islands in the passage began to grow and merge, and soon a broad isthmus formed between the island and the mainland. Then the volcano exploded, and a black pillar of ash and steam 9 m wide and 12 m high rose into the air. The column grew with each subsequent explosion, and reached a height of 3 km. Masses of flames the size of a room or smaller flew up to a height of 1.5 km and then fell to the earth or into the water with A deafening noise. There were no lava flows.\r\n</p><p>The eruption of the volcano lasted more than 24 hrs. According to rough estimates, it ejected 0.3 cubic km of material, which spread in the form of ash, mainly to the northwest of the volcano due to the prevailing southeast winds; 60,000,000 cubic m of fresh material was deposited immediately around the volcano under water and 190,000,000 cubic m was deposited above the water level. The height of the island increased from 9 to 200 m. Fields of pumice and ash 1/2 m thick floated in the bay.\r\n</p><p>The eruption of the Tawurwur Volcano began on May 30, after 13:00. The eruption lasted until the morning of the following day; about 2,300,000 cubic m of material was ejected. It also settled to the northwest of the volcano, that is, in the region of Rabaul, where the layer of ash was several cm thick.\r\n</p><p>During the first explosions of the Raluan Volcano, the underground shocks for the most part stopped. The water near Raluan Is was markedly agitated. At Rabaul, the water retreated 45 m several times, returned to the high high tide mark, and retreated again. Then the eruption was almost continuous for 3 hrs, but there were no noticeable oscillations in level.\r\n</p><p>Beginning at 19:00, the eruption began to pulsate, and periods of explosions began to alternate with periods of relative calm. It was precisely, during such a period of calm and before 21:00, that is, before the lip of the new crater of the volcano had completely risen above the water, that considerable oscillations in level were observed in the harbor. Four to five minutes passed between the rise and fall of the water. The amplitude of at least three of these waves was 2-2 1/2 m above and below the mean water level. A schooner was run aground by the wave onto a small pier and then dragged to the depths of the bay together with the pier. Several boats ran aground, and one or two sank. Subsequently, the oscillations apparently diminished, but their range was still 1/2 m early in the morning on the 30th.\r\n</p><p> During the eruption, <b>more than 500 people perished, including those who drowned</b>. At Rabaul, two homes and several small ships were destroyed in the rock and ash fall. After the earthquake and eruptions, a stretch of coast from Sulphur Creek to Matupi Island subsided, The\r\ndike joining this island with the mainland subsided 1 m.</p>",

Jesalva said he rushed back to the base camp at 3,000 feet to call for help.\r\n\r\nAmong the dead were three Germans and their Filipino guide, said Albay provincial Gov. Joey Salceda. He said everyone on the mountain had been accounted for at midday, except for a foreigner who was presumed dead.\r\n\r\nEight people were injured, and Salceda said the others were in the process of being brought down the mountain. Ash clouds have cleared over the volcano, which was quiet later in the morning.\r\n\r\n&#34;The injured are all foreigners ... They cannot walk. If you can imagine, the boulders there are as big as cars. Some of them slid and rolled down.

Strong explosions were accompanied by rumbling sounds, and shock waves that vibrated local structures. Dense ash plumes rose 2.3 km above the crater and drifted SW, W, NW, and N. Pyroclastic flows descended the Seca (Santa Teresa) drainage on the W flank, and possibly other drainages, though poor weather conditions prevented clear views of the summit area. Ash plumes drifted in westerly directions, causing ashfall (on roofs and cars).\r\n<p>On 5 June INSIVUMEH reported that activity again increased. Explosions occurring at a rate of 8-10/hour, some strong, generated ash plumes that rose 5 km and drifted E and NE.

The siblings, from Oregon, were exploring the Norris Geyser Basin, officials said, the park\u0092s oldest and hottest thermal area, when they deviated from the boardwalk that hovers safely aboveground and took their adventure off course. They walked 225 yards away from the boardwalk and into an isolated area, officials said, only a thin, feeble crust of earth separating their feet from the acidic water bubbling beneath. Then, somehow, Colin Scott slipped, and as his sister watched, the 23-year-old tumbled into one of the boiling springs. Despite her immediate call for help and the prolonged search efforts by park staff, her brother was never seen again. His flip-flops, reported NBC News, were one of the few things rescuers retrieved. They halted their recovery mission Wednesday, park spokeswoman Charissa Reid told the Associated Press, &#34;due to the extreme nature and futility of it all.&#34; The water was highly acidic, Reid said, leaving &#34;no remains left to recover.&#34; (reference #11744)",

On Tuesday, one flow hit a group of sand miners on the banks of the Gendol River, killing one person, injuring another and sweeping away several trucks...\r\n&#34;The danger on Merapi right now is only related to rain [mixing with] all the material that erupted in 2010,&#34; Agus Hendratno, a geologist and lecturer at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, told The Wall Street Journal on Friday. &#34;An early warning system was developed for the threat of mudflows, but sand miners often pay little heed to the warning.&#34; Hundreds of laborers work along the mountain\u0092s rivers each day to gather sand for cement production. Many excavate by hand... The governor of Yogyakarta, Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono X, warned people to stay away from Merapi\u0092s rivers after the death this week.\r\n&#34;There\u0092s no more forest on the upper parts of the mountain,&#34; he told local media. &#34;Mudflows and boulders can roll down like they\u0092re on a highway.&#34;\r\n(reference #10464)",

Seismicity (detected at five stations) generally increased from October 1993 to January 1994, corresponding to renewed eruptive activity. Very strong activity from January 1994 to January 1995 (comparable to 1976-77) ejected bombs in a radius of ~400 m from the crater rim (figure 4). Ashfall measured at the surveillance station totaled ~12 cm during January-October 1994. Seismicity remained high throughout 1994, then declined after January 1995.\r\nBecause Yasur is very accessible, it has been promoted as a tourist destination, resulting in a greater number of visitors and greater risk of accidents. In mid-January 1994 and early February 1995, when activity began to decline, there were two accidents with three victims. \r\n(reference #2432)",

Seismicity (detected at five stations) generally increased from October 1993 to January 1994, corresponding to renewed eruptive activity. Very strong activity from January 1994 to January 1995 (comparable to 1976-77) ejected bombs in a radius of ~400 m from the crater rim. Ashfall measured at the surveillance station totaled ~12 cm during January-October 1994. Seismicity remained high throughout 1994, then declined after January 1995.\r\nBecause Yasur is very accessible, it has been promoted as a tourist destination, resulting in a greater number of visitors and greater risk of accidents. In mid-January 1994 and early February 1995, when activity began to decline, there were two accidents with three victims. In one incident, two visitors on the crater rim died when they were struck by a 15 kg bomb ejected from the vent. \r\n(reference #2432)<p>\r\n\r\nTwo visitors on the crater rim died when they\r\nwere struck by a 15 kg bomb ejected from the vent.

On Tahulandang Island, from about the middle of February the residents of the island began to feel underground shocks. On March 2, chunks of stone began to roll down from the top of Ruang Volcano, standing in the sea 300 m from the island. On the 3rd at about 20:00 [local time], an earthquake began suddenly, and at the same time a thunderous rumble &#34;announced&#34; the eruption of the volcano. </p><p>A few seconds later, an enormous wave surged onto the coast of Tahulandang Island. It penetrated 180 m inland, and destroyed all the huts and plantations in its path. At the center of Tahulandang (Buhias) settlement, a wave rose 25 m above the usual sea level, as was determined by an official who investigated the island on March 30-31, from objects which caught on some trees which survived the waves. Two more waves followed the first wave at very short intervals.\r\n</p><p>Of the fluorishing settlement, consisting of 75 homes, there remained only three huts on its northern margin. However, they were all heavily damaged, and only one remained suitable for habitation; in addition, all the outbuildings and utensils kept under the huts were washed off. All the other homes were overturned and smashed or washed away, including a well-built church with stone walls 0.5 m thick. Bits of masonry were scattered around for a distance of up to 100 m, so that only the remaining paved courtyard indicated the previous site of the church. The earth was furrowed with ditches, carved out by the retreating water. The trees were uprooted and strewn helter-skelter with debris of homes and various utensils. A small ship was tossed to the foot of the mountain. The plantations situated on the mountain side remained intact. Out of the 500 residents of the settlement, 277 died.\r\n</p><p>Other settlements on the western and southwestern shore of the island also suffered destruction (Bohoi, Tulusan, Haasi). In all, about 400 people died on the island.\r\n</p><p>All the plantations and in general all the vegetation on the slopes of the Ruang Volcano were also destroyed. From 20:00 on March 9 to 14:00 on the 10th, there was a recurrent eruption of the volcano; sand and stones were ejected. Then the eruption resumed on March 14 and continued until 3:00.</p>",

        "comments": "On Friday, May 2, 2008, Chaiten Volcano in southeastern Chile erupted for the first time since about 7400 BC. Its initial eruption produced a plume of volcanic ash and steam that rose nearly 17 kilometers high. Winds carried the plume east, over the Andes Mountains and into Argentina. The plume then drifted out over the over the Atlantic Ocean. It was visible on satellite images for hundreds of kilometers over the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe town of Chaiten, located about 10 kilometers southwest of the eruption site, was blanketed with ash. About 4,000 people who lived there were evacuated by boat. One elderly person died during the evacuation efforts. On 6 May, the eruption became more forceful and generated a wider and darker gray ash plume to an estimated altitude of 30 km (98,400 ft) a.s.l. All remaining people in Chait\u00e9n were ordered to evacuate, as well as anyone within 50 km of the volcano.",
