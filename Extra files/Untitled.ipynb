       "  'comments': 'At least 10 Indians died, another 10 were injured and several are missing or trapped after the eruption of the Nevado del Huila volcano Thursday (Nov 20, 2008) night, government officials confirmed Saturday. Interior and Justice Minister Fabio Valencia Cossio told reporters that the first report of the eruption said that &#34;10 people died&#34; and that it has been impossible to establish &#34;whether there have been other tragic events.&#34; The official said that the natural phenomenon chiefly affected the indigenous reservations located between the municipalities of Inza and Balalcazar. The authorities have been unable to reach the highest parts of the volcano - located 285 kilometers (177 miles) southwest of Bogota - because bad weather has kept helicopters carrying supplies out of the area and the roads were obliterated by avalanches that occurred at the time of Thursday night&#39;s eruption. The eruption of the Nevado del Huila volcano on Thursday night formed a crater approximately 400 meters (1,300 feet) in diameter on one of the peaks of this mountain range in southwestern Colombia. The volcano is located in the central Andean range of Colombia, in a region where the provinces of Huila, Tolima and Cauca come together. The Bellavista stream, a tributary of the Paez River, was covered by the avalanche sparked by the interaction of the emerging hot lava with the layer of glacial ice.',\n",

In 338 Saka (that is, 416), a thunderous roar was heard from the bowels of Mount Ratuwara (also called Pulosari, an extinct volcano in the Banten region, the closest to the Sunda strait). This roar was answered by an identical roar from the bowels of Mount Kapi, which is situated west of the modern [region?] of Eanten. An enormous blinding flame, which reached the heavens, exploded from Kapi* Mountain. The whole world shook, Thunder pealed out, a storm burst, and it began to rain. However, the eruption of flame from Mount Kapi not only did not diminish with the rain , but even increased, The roar was terrifying. In the end, Mount Kapi exploded into pieces with a terrific noise and descended into the depths of the earth. A sea wave arose and inundated the land... After the water receded, Mount Kapi and its locality were left on the sea bottom, while Java Island split into two parts. Thus the islands of Sumatra and Java were separated. [The events are very similar to the famous eruption of Krakatau in 1883. It is possible that Mount Kapi is in fact the Krakatau Volcano.] \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2771:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>According to ancient Japanese scriptures, the first known supercolossal eruption of Krakatau occurred in the year 416 A. D. - Some have reported it to occur in 535 A.D. The energy of this eruption is estimated to have been about 400 megatons of TNT, or the equivalent of 20,000 Hiroshima bombs. This violent early eruption destroyed the volcano,\\r\\nwhich collapsed and created a 7 km wide submarine caldera. The remnants of this earlier violent volcanic explosion were the three islands of Krakatau, Verlaten and Lang (Rakata, Panjang, and Sertung). Undoubtedly the 416 A.D. eruption/explosion/collapse generated a series of catastrophic tsunamis, which must have been much greater than those generated in 1883. The time of tsunami with wave height of several meters that affected Tamilnadu in\\r\\nIndia matches with this early Krakatau eruption. However, there are no other records to document the size of these early tsunamis or the destruction they caused. Subsequent to the 416 A.D. eruption and prior to 1883, three volcanic cones of Krakatau and at least one older caldera had combined again to form the island of Rakata. \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2432:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>The renowned volcano Krakatau (frequently misstated as Krakatoa) lies in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra. Collapse of the ancestral Krakatau edifice, perhaps in 416 AD, formed a 7-km-wide caldera. Remnants of this ancestral volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently Rakata, Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island.</p>',\n",

The towns of Palmer, San Felipe, Coombia, and Centepee, are all ruined. Ashes are 7 ft. deep in the tineas and towns. Mud, stones, and lava have fallen all over the country. Houses have been crushed by the weight of the volcanic material that has fallen upon them. Retalhuleu, Mazatenango, and Quezaltenango have not suffered so much, but this calamity is only beginning.

Those who have come in from the region immediate to the zone of devastation insist that all who were in the towns of Pilmar, San Felipe, Colombia, and Coatepee must have perished. </p><p>LOSS REACHES MILLIONS.<br />The property losses are enormous. The estimates of these losses are in varying millions. The coffee fincas of the Western Department of Guatemala were among the most productive and profitable in the world. On October 31 advices were received in this city to the effect that the entire coffee zone of Guatemala had been destroyed, and that the lives of all engaged on the fincas and living in the towns and villages were in imminent danger. Later information not only confirms these first reports, but greatly enlarges the area of destruction and vastly increases the amount of loss to the coffee planters. </p><p>AN OFFICIAL REPORT.<br />Mr. James C. McNally, United States Consul-General at Guatemala City, in his official report to the State Department, estimates the total loss at more than £1,000,000. He says ; \\x97 &#34;As a climax to the terrible earthquakes of April 18, which practically compassed the ruin of Quezaltenango, the volcano Santa Maria, almost adjoining that city, erupted on October 24, throwing out quantities of mud and ashes, causing untold damage on the coast side, which comprises the rich coffee zone of Guatemala. The volcano is still active, and ashes are falling on places 30 miles distant from the crater.&#34; </p><p>FIFTEEN THOUSAND PERSONS DEAD.<br />Mr. Hans Lang left here six weeks ago to assume the position of assistant manager of the plantation of Lucerno, near Osuna. In speaking of the loss of life resulting from the eruption, Mr. Lang said:--&#34;In Guatemala City it was estimated that 15,000 lives were lost. The exact number will never be known, as thousands lie buried beneath the ashes, and their bodies will never be recovered. I was stationed fifty miles from Santa Maria, and no ashes fell on my plantation, although the rumblings were distinctly heard and the lightning flashes plainly seen. When the volcano of Fuego, adjacent to the plantation, began to belch forth smoke, I thought it time to decamp, so I made my way to Guatemala City.</p></i></i>',\n",

The ashfall was focused on the west coast and in Lombok and Bali, the ash was so thick that many people were killed immediately when the roofs of their homes collapsed due to the weight of the ash.</p><p>The blanket of ash fallout on Sumbawa destroyed all crops, resulting in famine immediately after the eruption. These effects were not restricted to Sumbawa as famine and disease brought about by the eruption was severe on distant islands as well. On Lombok, estimates of the death toll ranged from 44,000 to 100,000 and on Bali at least 25,000. A conservative number of deaths from the eruption and subsequent famine and disease is 117,000.</p><p>The eruption emitted large quantities of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere which caused 1816 to be termed &#34;the  year without summer.&#34; As average temperatures fell 1 to 2.5 degrees C below normal throughout New England and western Europe.</p><p>News of this distant eruption in Indonesia did not reach the Western world for some time, but unusual atmospheric phenomena and climate deterioration set in during 1816\\x97&#34;the year without summer.&#34; ...Tambora-size (ca 100 km3 of magna) explosive volcanic eruptions emit large quantities of sulfur dioxide gas into the stratosphere, where it is converted into a sulfuric acid aerosol dust veil that encircles the Earth. The aerosol has the effect of reducing solar heat reaching the surface of the planet, leading to global cooling. Strange atmospheric phenomena had been observed in Europe before the summer of 1816. In May 1815 the sunsets in England were exceptionally colorful, and by September the sky seemed to be on fire every evening. But the spectacular skies brought bad weather the following year, and the year 1816 is the worst on record in Europe, with the mean temperature about 3 deg C below average across the entire continent from Britain in the north to Tunisia in the south. In England the summer was miserable, with the mean temperature for June the lowest on record, or 12.9 deg C. In France it was so cold that the wine harvest was later than at any time since record keeping began--delayed until November in those districts where the grapes were not already frozen on the vine. In Germany crops failed, a situation exacerbated by the war with Napoleon, and famine and price inflation were widespread. Conditions in Germany became so intolerable that people in many districts rioted and set off in search of better living conditions, starting the great migration from northern Europe east to Russia and west to America. The severe weather in fact led to crop failure of all the major crops in Europe and doubling of the price of wheat from 1815 to 1817. When we consider than in the early part of the 19th century agriculture was the mainstay of society, it is clear that the climate change had a strong impact on the economy of the western world. </p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2432:</i></blockquote> <p>VEI 7, Tephra Volume: 1.6x 10<sup>11</sup> m<sup>3</sup>. \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #9675</i></blockquote> \\r\\nApproximately 11,000 direct deaths from bomb impacts, tephra falls, and tsunamis; recent work indicates pyroclastic flows reached all but W coast and probably caused most direct fatalities on Sumbawa.\\r\\n<p>Indirect effects: An estimated 49,000 persons died of famine and disease on Sumbawa and Lombok islands following the eruption.

Another says very considerable number of victims. (reference #9675)\\r\\n<p>In the first months of this year [1871], about February 16, earthquakes became very frequent; shortly after\\r\\nthe inhabitants of Mambajao and Catarman became convinced that the radiating center of the seismic disturbance was located in their little island, and not very far distant in the same mountain, whose fertile side, covered with verdure, had never been suspected of harboring a dangerous enemy... \\r\\n</p><p>On the 21st [Feb] at 4 o\\x92clock a. m. a violent earthquake shook the island, causing considerable\\r\\ndamage to the stone buildings. On the flank of the mountain the sight was dreadful. The rolling masses of stone were destroying trees and plantations, while the opening\\r\\nof fissures caused a noise like that of a great storm. The inhabitants of the town were terrified and from this moment began to escape in their boats to the neighboring\\r\\ncoasts of Mindanao and Bohol in search of safety...\\r\\n</p><p>During the months of March and April earthquakes succeeded one another with the same frequency and\\r\\nwere accompanied by effects identical with those just described... The inhabitants of the towns in the neighborhood of Mt. Catarman, with the exception of a few of the bolder spirits and some of the very poor, fled from their houses. Hence it is that when the eruption actually took place it found very few victims. \\r\\n</p><p>At last the shocks suddenly ceased. When day broke on April 30, at the foot of Mt. Catarman, which had been so shaken by the preceding earthquakes that it exposed its skeleton through the landslides and fissures, a column of thick vapor was seen rising up into the sky near the sea and about 400 yards distant from the town of Catarman. This column of vapor disappeared completely some hours afterwards. </p><p>At about 7 p. m. of the same day a tremendous explosion was heard in the direction of the above-mentioned spot, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke, which came from the same place. Everything roundabout\\r\\nwas set on fire. At the same time a shower of stones, earth, and ashes was vomited forth from the recently made openings. The ashes rose to a considerable height, spreading out and reaching Cebu and other islands 110 miles away. Within a radius of 2 miles from the new crater the destruction caused by the shower of fire, stones, earth,\\r\\nand ashes was almost complete; but fortunately there is no report of many human victims, evidently because the inhabitants of Catarman, which the destruction reached, had fled in due time to safer quarters. The eruption continued for six or seven days, after which the paroxysm died down, but the silent flowing of the semifluid lava continued,\\r\\nbuilding up a rough cone, which in two or three weeks&#39; time\\r\\nmeasured some eight feet in height...\\r\\n</p><p>(above from reference #2070)</p>',\n",

The first shocks appear to have occurred in the night of the 8th of last month, and they increased until they became so violent that the white inhabitants fled from their dwellings and the natives hid themselves in the bush. The shocks were very severe on Ambrym, Pentecost and Espritu Santo. So far as could be learnt no loss of life had taken place, but on the coast station dwellings were shaken to pieces. The earthquake was due to an eruption of a volcano near Epi. Describing that outburst, a passenger by the steamer La Parouse said: &#34;Immense vomiting jets of smoke and flame went skyward. The spectacle as viewed from the deck of the La Parouse was impressively grand.&#34; The eruption was followed by a tidal wave, which did infinitely greater damage to the plantations than the eruption.

By Aug 20, mudflows had killed more than 100. Disease at evacuation camps had (by Sept 20) brought the total fatalities to about 800. \\r\\n<blockquote>Reference #2432</blockquote>\\r\\nPrior to 1991 Pinatubo volcano was a relatively unknown, heavily forested lava dome complex located 100 km NW of Manila with no records of historical eruptions. The 1991 eruption, one of the world&#39;s largest of the 20th century, ejected massive amounts of tephra and produced voluminous pyroclastic flows, forming a small, 2.5-km-wide summit caldera whose floor is now covered by a lake. Caldera formation lowered the height of the summit from 1745 to 1486 m. Although the eruption caused hundreds of fatalities and major damage with severe social and economic impact, successful monitoring efforts greatly reduced the number of fatalities. Widespread lahars that redistributed products of the 1991 eruption have continued to cause severe disruption.\\r\\n<p>March 1991. The press reported that an explosion on 2 April deposited ash over an area of about 10,000 m2, including part of one village, and that about 2,000 people were evacuated. No injuries or deaths were reported. PHIVOLCS confirmed the explosion, and later noted a SW-NE-trending line of new vents extending 0.5-1.0 km on the N side of the volcano. The vents continued to emit a gas plume 200-500 m high as of mid-April. Observers at Clark Air Force Base (~15 km E) reported sulfurous odors. A seismic net, installed following the 2 April explosion, recorded increasing seismicity, reaching 135 earthquakes on 15 April.\\r\\n</p><p>April 1991. On 2 April, an explosion at the E end of Pinatubo&#39;s geothermal area (about 1.5 km NW of the summit and 2/3 of the way down the flank) ejected clouds of steam and minor quantities of ash to 500-800 m height. Ash fell 2 km away, primarily to the NW and SW, and covered an area of about 10,000 m2, including part of one village, from which about 2,000 people were evacuated. No injuries or deaths were reported. \\r\\n</p><p>May-June 1991. After more than 2 months of increasing seismicity, deformation, and emission of small plumes, a series of strong explosions culminated in one of the largest eruptions of this century. The 15-16 June climactic phase lasted more than 15 hours, sending tephra to 30 km altitude, generating voluminous pyroclastic flows, and leaving a small caldera in the former summit region. Ten days later, the aerosol cloud formed a nearly continuous band that stretched 11,000 km from Indonesia to Central Africa. Timely evacuations saved many lives, but the combined effects of the eruption and a typhoon killed more than 300 people.\\r\\n</p><blockquote>Reference #11546</blockquote>\\r\\nBy early June [1991], officials called for the evacuation of 25,000 people living in the area, including American service people at Clark Air Base and the U.S. Naval Station at Subic Bay. &#34;By June 14 the recommended evacuation radius was 30 kilometers, which would have applied to perhaps 400,000 people,&#34; Newhall said. Never before had such a widespread evacuation attempt been made before a volcanic eruption. By the time the volcano erupted on 15 June, scientists and public officials had convinced more than 65,000 people to evacuate. More than 350 died during the eruption, but USGS and PHIVOLCS estimate that evacuation efforts saved between 5000 and 20,000 lives.\\r\\n<blockquote>Reference #11542</blockquote>The eruption of Mt Pinatubo In June 1991 caused the largest perturbation this century to the particulate content of the stratosphere. The radiative influence of the injected particles put an end to several years of globally warm surface temperatures.

Prior to the earthquake, normal background seismicity prevailed; a series of aftershocks also took place beneath the volcano. Earthquake damage was attributed to shaking, mass movement of loosened material, and flooding. The volcano&#39;s topography and volcanic deposits contributed to the disaster, but the primary area of landslides lay S of the main volcanic edifice and reached a maximum elevation of ~3,000 m. Aerial observers on 7 July saw no changes in either the vigor of fumaroles present near the summit or in the distribution and surface appearance of glaciers.

No eruption. (reference #9675)\\r\\n<p>Crater lake overflow causes flooding; no volcanic activity. The overflow of Maughan Lake, the crater lake at Parker volcano, followed heavy rains associated with a passing typhoon and caused flash flooding in NW-flank communities on 6 September. A team from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) was dispatched to determine whether the overflow was caused by volcanic activity. Although no volcanic alert was declared, PHIVOLCS recommended that the crater area should be considered off-limits because of instability of the crater walls. Fieldwork on 8-9 September revealed that the flood was channel-confined along the NW-flank Alah River, which drains the crater lake, from 1,000 m down to 540 m elevation (Barangay New Dumangas, T&#39;boli, South Cotabato Province). Below this point it was transformed into a sheetwash. The floods killed more than 60 people, destroyed 300 homes and nine bridges, and displaced 50,000. (reference #2432)</p>',\n",

       "  'comments': 'Stromboli was hit by a set of violent eruptions Wednesday and the Mayor of Lipari, the biggest of the Aeolian Islands off Sicily that Stromboli belongs too, said one person was killed. Mayor Marco Giorgianni told ANSA that the victim was tourist who had trekked up to the summit of the volcano. The eruptions caused scared beach tourists to take to the sea. Two new lava spouts are creeping down the volcano on the famed island. The volcano is also shooting out red-hot rocks called lapilli which are setting fore to cane breaks, local sources said. &#34;A huge column of dense black smoke is coming out of the crater,&#34; an eye witness said. Another said &#34;there was a powerful explosion. We heard a bang, then a column of smoke and lapilli fell onto Ginostra, and flames on the slopes of the volcano&#34;. Fires have broken out across the island, fire services and forest rangers said. A journalist and owner of a bazar at Ginsotra, Gianluca Giuffre, told ANSA &#34;all the people who were in the village about a hundred tourists and residents, either holed up at home or threw themselves into the sea. (reference #12459)\\r\\n<p>Two pyroclastic flows were produced as a result of the explosions; they traveled down the Sciara and across the water for about 1 km before collapsing into the sea (figure 150). A hiker from Sicily was killed in the eruption and a Brazilian friend who was with him was badly injured, according to a Sicilian news source, ANSA, and the New York Post. They were hit by flying ejecta while hiking in the Punta dei Corvi area, due W of the summit and slightly N of Ginostra, about 100 m above sea level according to INGV. Most of the ejecta from the explosion dispersed to the WSW of the summit. Fallout also ignited vegetation on the slopes which narrowly missed destroying structures in the town.

A volcanologist at the monitoring post for Paluweh noted that the eruption lasted seven minutes, and that the pyroclastic flow burned trees around the beach and villages, making it difficult to reach the victims. Pyroclastic flows continued to be reported hours after the initial eruption. Based on analyses of satellite imagery and wind data, the Darwin VAAC reported that an ash plume rose to an altitude of 4.3 km (14,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted 130 km W.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNews sources noted that a mandatory evacuation order had caused some residents to evacuate prior to the eruption on 10 August, but nearly 10,000 still remained on the island. After the eruption, a rescue team was sent to evacuate about 2,000 people that remained inside a 3-km exclusion zone. A team member noted that rescuing people was difficult since they were reluctant to leave their livestock and homes, but also that the ground was hot and covered in 10-20 cm of ash. The VAAC reported that during 11-12 August ash plumes rose to an altitude of 1.8 km (6,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted 110-130 km W. A news article noted that the eruptions were smaller on 12 August, but pyroclastic flows continued to be observed. The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a scale of 0-4).</p>',\n",

It considerably disturbed the instruments at the astronomical observatory. The crosslines of the tubes of the transit instrument after the shock experienced spasmodic oscillations which were larger north-south than east-west. Then came news that the shocks may have been connected with an eruption of the volcano on Tanna Island. The news was delivered to the Vagap post office by a small English schooner, which had been situated near the volcano at the time of the eruptions.

All 3,150 people in the path of these flows, on islands between Krakatau and Sumatra were killed; probably most by early tsunami but surely none survived the culminating eruption at 1000 on Aug 27.

Collapse of the ancestral Krakatau edifice, perhaps in 416 AD, formed a 7-km-wide caldera. Remnants of this ancestral volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently Rakata, Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island. Caldera collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes, and left only a remnant of Rakata volcano. This eruption, the 2nd largest in Indonesia during historical time, caused more than 36,000 fatalities, most as a result of devastating tsunamis that swept the adjacent coastlines of Sumatra and Java. Pyroclastic surges traveled 40 km across the Sunda Strait and reached the Sumatra coast. After a quiescence of less than a half century, the post-collapse cone of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former cones of Danan and Perbuwatan. Anak Krakatau has been the site of frequent eruptions since 1927.\\r\\n</p><p>Start date of eruption: 1883 May 20 \\t\\r\\n</p><p>Stop date of eruption: 1883 Oct 21 (?)\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #9779:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>Krakatau (or Krakatoa), an island volcano lying in the Sunda Straits between Java and Sumatra at 6<sup>o</sup> S, erupted violently on August 26 and 27, 1883.

       "  'comments': 'A volcano in Gunma Prefecture, north of Tokyo, erupted on Tuesday morning, leaving one dead and 11 injured by falling rocks. Japan&#39;s Meteorological Agency says large volcanic tremors were detected at Mount Kusatsu-Shirane at around 10 AM. Volcanic rocks were confirmed in the area more than one kilometer from the volcano&#39;s crater.\\r\\n<p>Some of the rocks fell when Ground Self-Defense Force members were training at a nearby ski resort. Eight of the members were hit by rocks. One died and the rest were injured.\\r\\n</p><p>Four skiers were also injured when rocks shattered the windows of a ropeway gondola.\\r\\nLocal authorities say about 80 people who were stuck at a gondola station near the summit have been safely rescued.\\r\\n</p><p>Weather officials have raised the volcanic alert level to 3, and are warning people not to approach the volcano.\\r\\n</p><p>The Self-Defense Forces initially said people were injured when an avalanche hit the ski resort, but later said the injuries were due to falling volcanic rocks. They added that they had not confirmed an avalanche.\\r\\n</p><p>(All above from reference #11997)\\r\\n</p><p>JMA reported that at 0959 on 23 January an eruption began at Kusatsu-Shiranesan coincident with the onset of volcanic tremor; there were no indications of an impending eruption. The Alert Level was raised to 3 (on a scale of 1-5). Skiers at the popular ski resort Kusatsu Kokusai took video showing a plume of tephra and ejected bombs rising from a vent on the Motoshiranesan edifice, about 2 km SSE of Yagama Crater on Shiranesan (where all previous historical activity has been). The eruption also caused what appeared to be an avalanche. Photos and video posted in news articles showed tephra drifting E and blanketing the nearby hillside; JMA noted ashfall in Nakanojo-machi, in the Gunma Prefecture. Tephra hit a gondola, shattering glass and injuring four skiers. Material crashed through the roof of a lodge, where about 100 people had already been evacuated. Ground Self-Defense Force troops were engaging in ski training at the time of the event; one member died and seven others were injured. Emergency responders gathered at the Sanroku Station to assist. On 24 January JMA noted that volcanic earthquakes were numerous but decreasing in number, and two 2-3-minute-long periods of volcanic tremor were detected at 1015 and 1049.

       "  'comments': 'A rumbling volcano in western Indonesia on Saturday unleashed fresh clouds of searing gas that killed at least 14 people and injured three, only a day after villagers who fled earlier eruptions returned home thinking it was safe, officials said. The dead included four high school students on a school trip to see the volcano and a local journalist, said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. He said that the government on Friday allowed nearly 14,000 people living outside a three-mile danger zone to return home after the volcano&#39;s activity decreased. Mount Sinabung&#39;s morning eruption was followed by a more powerful blast that sent lava and pyroclastic flows down southern slopes up to 2.8 miles away, Nugroho said. Television footage showed villages, farms and trees around the 8,530-foot -high volcano covered in thick gray ash. Authorities were still preventing more than 16,000 villagers living along the path of hot clouds from going back to their homes, but many of them insisted on checking their houses and farms after more than four months of being crammed into temporary shelters. Authorities raised the alert status for Sinabung to the highest level in November. (reference #10862)\\r\\n<p>The death toll from an Indonesian volcano that has been rumbling for months rose to 16 Sunday after rescuers found another charred corpse and a critically injured college student died in a hospital, officials said. (reference #10863)\\r\\n</p><p>Officials said about 170 people armed with chainsaws and oxygen apparatus spread out through the destruction in Sukameriah village, just 2.7 kilometres from Sinabung\\x92s crater, on Sunday before the search was called off. &#34;There\\x92s no sign of human life. All the crops were gone. Many houses were damaged and those still standing were covered in thick white ash. It was hard to walk in ash which nearly reached my calves,&#34; Gito, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, told reporters. (reference #10866)\\r\\n</p><p>12 March-18 March 2014. PVMBG described activity at Sinabung during 8-15 March based on observations from a post in the Ndokum Siroga village, 8.5 km away... The report also noted that three people burned during a pyroclastic flow on 1 February later died in the hospital bringing the <b>total number of casualties from that day to 17</b>. The Alert Level remained at 4 (on a scale of 1-4). Visitors and tourists were prohibited from approaching the crater within a radius of 5 km. (reference #2432).</p>',\n",

Based on visual observations and measurements, the height of Mount Anak Krakatau, which was originally 338 meters, is currently only 110 meters. The volume of Mount Anak Krakatau decreased. The volume lost is estimated at 150-180 million cubic meters. The remaining volume currently ranges from 40-70 million cubic meters. The reduced body volume of Gunung Anak Krakarau is estimated because of the volcanic body creep process accompanied by high eruption rates from 24-27 / 12/2018.Observation of Gunung Anak Krakatau volcanic activity is still being monitored intensively by PVMBG. The status of Gunung Anak Krakatau remains at Standby level (Level III). It is recommended to the public not to approach Mount Anak Krakatau within a radius of 5 km from the crater because it is dangerous from throwing incandescent rocks, lava flows, hot clouds and heavy ash rain. (reference #12325)</p><p>On 22 December 2018, Anak Krakatau (\\x91Child of Krakatau\\x92), an active volcanic island situated within the Krakatau caldera in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra, Indonesia, experienced a flank failure. This flank failure generated a volcanogenic tsunami, causing 35 widespread damage to the surrounding coastlines[...]On the day of the tsunami, the Anak Krakatau volcano was in an elevated but unexceptional phase of activity, undergoing a strombolian-style eruption. An ash column of up to 1.5 km was observed, and earthquake tremors of typical amplitude were recorded. (reference #12376)</p>',\n",

The helicopter was on a rescue mission to the Dieng Plateau in Central Java where an active volcanic crater and famous tourist destination, Sileri Crater, erupted at 12 p.m. It was spurting cold lava and sending smoke 50 meters in the air. The helicopter departed from the Central Java\\x92s provincial capital of Semarang at 4 p.m. Basarnas operational director Maj. Gen. Heronimus Guru confirmed there were eight people on board the ill-fated helicopter, consisting of four crew and four rescuers. Central Java Basarnas spokesman Zulhawary Agustianto told The Jakarta Post they predicted the helicopter hit a cliff in an area called Canggal in Candiroto district.\\r\\n</p><p>At least 17 tourists were at the crater when the eruption occurred, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB). Ten of them who sustained injuries, which ranged from bruises to a fractured arm, were immediately brought to a nearby community health center to receive treatment. &#34;The authorities asked visitors and residents to vacate the area because there was potential for the crater to erupt for a second time,&#34; BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a statement. The phreatic eruption was caused by gas pressure under the ground, resulting in an explosion that sent out a mix of steam, water, ash and mud, Sutopo added.\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2432:</i></blockquote>\\r\\nBNPB reported that a phreatic eruption at the Sileri Crater lake (Dieng Volcanic Complex) occurred at 1154 on 2 July, ejecting mud and material 150 m high, and 50 m to the N and S. The event injured 11 of 18 tourists that were near the crater. According to a news article a helicopter on the way to help evacuated people after the event crashed, killing all eight people (four crewmen and four rescuers) on board. <p> PVMBG scientists visited the next day and observed weak white emissions rising 60 m. The report noted other events during the recent past; an event at 1303 on 30 April ejected material 10 m high and 1 m past the crater edge that formed a 1-2 mm thick deposit, and an emission at 0941 on 24 May consisting of gas and black &#34;smoke&#34; that rose 20 m. The Alert Level remained at 1 (on a scale of 1-4) and PVMBG warned the public not to approach Sileri Crater within a 100-m radius.</p>',\n",

Visitors and residents were prohibited from approaching the crater within a 10-km radius. BNPB reported that a major eruption occurred less than two hours later at 2250, followed by another large explosion at 2330. Ash plumes rose to an altitude of 17 km (55,800 ft) a.s.l. and caused ashfall in areas NE, NW, and W, as far as Pacitan (133 km WSW), Kulon Progo (236 km W), Temanggung (240 km WNW), and Banyuwangi (228 km E). Forty flights from the Juanda (81 km NE), Adi Sucipto Yogya (208 km W), and Adi Sumarmo Solo (175 km WNW) airports were cancelled. News articles reported that flights in and out of seven airports were cancelled or rerouted. Ashfall and tephra 5-8 cm in diameter caused structures to collapse, including schools, homes, and businesses. On 14 February BNPB reported that the eruption had <b>killed four people: one died due to a collapsing wall, one from ash inhalation, and two from &#34;shortness of breath&#34;</b>. All four victims lived within 7 km of Kelut in the regency of Malang, an area that received ashfall up to 20 cm thick. By 0600 the number of displaced people reached 100,248, but the report also noted that activity had declined. A report issued later that day noted that 76,388 people remained evacuated. Seismicity continued to decline and was at moderate levels during 15-17 February. An 18 February report noted that a total of <b>seven people in Malang had died</b>, and that the ashfall had affected cattle health and dairy production, farms, and the water supply. Damage to infrastructure in Malang included 3,782 houses, 20 government buildings, 251 schools, nine hospitals, and 36 churches.  (reference #2432)',\n",

Area of Activity: SW flank (near Mt. Tabaro). (reference #2432)\\r\\n</p><p>A moderately violent phreatomagmatic explosive eruption of Taal Volcano, in the Philippines, occurred from 28 to 30 September 1965. The main phreatic explosions, which were\\r\\npreceded by ejection of basaltic spatter, opened a new crater 1.5 kilometers long and 0.3 kilometer wide on the southwest side of Volcano Island in Lake Taal. The eruption covered an area of about 60 square kilometers with a blanket of ash more than 25 centimeters thick and killed approximately 190 persons. The clouds that formed during the explosive eruption rose to heights of 15 to 20 kilometers and deposited fine ash as far as 80 kilometers west of the vent. At the base of the main explosion column, flat, turbulent clouds spread radially, with hurricane velocity, transporting ash, mud, lapilli, and blocks. The horizontally moving, debris-laden clouds sandblasted trees, coated the blast side of trees and houses with mud, and deposited coarse ejecta with dune-type bedding in a zone roughly 4 kilometers in all directions from the explosion crater.

(ref #1686)</p><p>On Aug 11, 1749, began one of the most violent outbursts of Taal on record. It has been described by Fr. Buencuchillo, 0. S. A,, an eye-witness, since he was at the time parish-priest of Sala. During the night of that day the top of the mountain burst out with tremendous force from the same crater which since ancient times used to emit fire and rocks. The course of events was this:</p><p>At about 11 o&#39;clock of the night I had noticed a rather extensive glare over the top of the island; but entirely unaware of what this might portent, I paid no special attention to it and retired to rest. Around 3 o&#39;clock in the morning of the 12th, I heard something like heavy artillery fire and began to count the reports, taking it for granted that they came from the ship which was expected to arrive from New Spain [Mexico] and which, according to an ancient custom, on entering Balayan Bay saluted Our Lady of Caysasay. I thought it strange, however, when I found that the number of detonations already exceeded one hundred, and still they did not cease. This caused me to rise with some anxiety as to what could be the matter; but my doubts were quickly dispelled, as at this moment there appeared four excited natives who shouted: &#34;Father, let us leave this place! The volcano has burst out and all this noise and racket comes from it!&#34;</p><p>By this time it began to dawn, and we saw the immense column of smoke which rose from the summit of the island, while several smaller whiffs issued from other openings. I confess that the spectacle, far from frightening me, rather delighted my eyes, especially when I noticed that also from the water there arose enormous columns of sand and ashes, which ascended in the shape of pyramids to marvelous heights and then fell back into the lake like illuminated fountains.</p><p>...During my flight I saw a great many tall trees, such as coconut and betel-nut palms, either miserably fallen, or so deeply buried that their tops were within reach of my hands. I likewise saw several houses which formerly, in accordance with Philippine custom, had their floors raised several yards above ground, but had sunk to such a degree that the same ladder which once served to ascend into them, was now used to descend to them. The most remarkable thing about this is that the natives tranquilly continue occupying them, though they find themselves buried alive.</p><p>It rained ashes in considerable quantity and that part of them which remained suspended in the air, formed a vast cloud which grew so dense as to cause real darkness during the hours of broad daylight.</p><p>Fr. Murillo states in his &#34;Geografia Historica, etc.,&#34; that he was at the time at the Sanctuary of Antipolo which lies 21 km almost due east from Manila. During the eruption he felt three or four earthquakes of such violence that the roof tiles of the tower were thrown to a distance of more than 10 meters. Of less intense shocks there were more than one hundred, and the earth trembled frequently during more than a year. There were likewise fierce thunderstorms during many days.</p><p>(above from ref #2340)</p>',\n",

As Saderra Maso refers to 4 villages around lake being completely destroyed, these fatalities may refer only to those in Taal village. Permanent abandonment of several villages on lake shore. (reference #9675)</p><p>Of the eruption in 1754, the greatest recorded in the history of Taal Volcano, we have likewise a description from the pen of worthy Fr. Buencuchillo, at the time stationed at Taal, of which narrative the following is an abridgement:</p><p>On May 15, 1754, at about 9 or 10 o&#39;clock in the night, the volcano quite unexpectedly commenced to roar and emit, sky-high, formidable flames intermixed with glowing rocks which, falling back upon the island and rolling down the slopes of the mountain, created the impression of a large river of fire. During the following days there appeared in the lake a large quantity of pumice stone which had been ejected by the volcano. Part of these ejecta had also reached the hamlet of Bayuyungan and completely destroyed it.</p><p>The volcano continued thus until June 2, during the night of which the eruption reached such proportions that the falling ejecta made the entire island appear to be on fire, and it was even feared that the catastrophe might involve the shores of the lake. From the said 2d of June until September 25, the volcano never ceased to eject fire and mud of such bad character that the best ink does not cause so black a stain.</p><p>During the night of September 25, the fire emitted was quite extraordinary and accompanied by terrifying rumblings. The strangest thing was, that within the black column of smoke issuing from the volcano ever since June 2, there frequently formed thunderstorms, and it happened that the huge tempest cloud would scarcely ever disappear during two months.</p><p>At daybreak of September 26 we found ourselves forced to abandon our dwelling for fear lest the roofs come down upon us under the weight of ashes and stones which had fallen upon them during that hapless night. In fact, some weaker buildings collapsed. The depth of the layer of ashes and stones exceeded two &#34;cuartas&#34; [45 centimeters or 18 inches], and the result was that there was neither tree nor other plant which it did not ruin or crush, giving to the whole region an aspect as if a devastating conflagration had swept over it. After this the volcano calmed down considerably, though not sufficiently to offer any prospect of tranquility.</p><p><strong>Twelve persons are known to have perished</strong>-some carried away by the waves of the lake, others crushed beneath their collapsing houses. Thus the beautiful town of Taal remains a deserted wilderness and reduced to the utmost misery, while once it was one of the richest and most flourishing places. In the villages to the west of the lake, which were the greater and better part, all the houses have either collapsed under the load of material which had been piled upon them or have disappeared completely, swept away by the waves which in these places were so violent that they dug three ditches or channels, too wide and deed to be forded, and thus rendered impassable the road which joins the town with Balayan. In other parts of the lake shore have likewise opened many cracks and occurred very extensive slides. The worst of all is, that, the mouth of the river Pansipit having been blocked, the lake is rising and invading the towns of Lipa and Tanauan, both being on the lowest level, and inundating their buildings. All the animals of whatever kind have perished, some by being buried, others by drowning, the rest by starving, as not a green blade remained anywhere.</p><p>(above from reference #2340)</p>',\n",

On Sangihe Is, after a sudden &#34;unbearable&#34; roar, the Awu Volcano began to erupt. Incandescent lava rushed down the slopes of the mountain with irresistible force, destroying everything in its path. Where the lava reached the shore, the sea water began to boil. Strong hot springs gushed up and the abundant surging boiling water destroyed and carried away everything that the fire had spared. \\r\\n</p><p>The sea surged onto the shore cliffs as during an underwater earthquake, and with a terrifying noise, it flooded the coast and &#34;snatched its victims from the fire.&#34;\\r\\n</p><p>An hour later, thunderous blows were heard, shaking the earth. A black column of ash and stones was ejected from the peak of the mountain. The column rose to the &#34;heavens&#34; and fell in a rain of fire on the slopes of the volcano, which were lit up by the red hot lava. Total darkness\\r\\nfell, in which one could not make out the closest objects; it was interrupted from time to time by outbreaks of light. Large bombs fell to the earth. The settlements and field s not destroyed by the lava were buried under a layer of ash and rocks. The flows rushed down from the mountain, and, encountering obstacles, spread out in lakes, which then became a new source of destruction.</p><p>All this took several hours. By midnight, all had quieted down, although the eruption began with new force the next noon. The ashfall continued all day and was so intensive that no light could penetrate, and almost total darkness set in.</p><p>A hurricane southeastern wind blew since the beginning of the eruption, and the ashes were carried as far as Mindanao Island. Later the wind blew from the north.</p><p>On March 17, there was a new eruption, in which fields and trees on the coast at Tabukan were destroyed. After this, the volcano quieted down, except that steam continuously rose from the numerous cracks and fractures. However, the lava flows were still so hot that one could not approach them. According to residents, the top of the volcano did not change noticeably in appearance.</p><p>At the main village of the island, Tahuna, several people were injured and homes were destroyed during the fall of ash and stones. Obstacles in the form of hills made the lava flow deviate from the village and turn to the sea in another place.</p><p>Along the flat slope between Tahuna and Kandhar, seven large lava flows descended to the sea, devastating this agricultural region. One of the flows passed through Kalongan village; only a few burned posts were left. Between Kalongan and Kandhar, a large area of the coast subsided below sea level. The mountain side had previously sloped gently to the very water line; after the eruption, it broke off as a steep wall about 60 m (200 feet) high.</p><p>The settlement of Kandhar, protected by this &#34;rib,&#34; suffered little: it was affected only by the fall of ashes and stones and the streams of hot water. In addition, before the eruption, the residents, fearing pirates, had hidden with their belongings in the thickets above the settlement, and did not suffer from the flooding.</p><p>The devastation was even greater on the coast from Kandhar to the northern tip of the island. Two tongues of lava thrust far into the sea to previous bottom marks of several metres (fathoms).</p><p>The number of victims was considerable: at Tahuna 722, at Kandhar 22, at Tabukan 2,039; total 2,806. For the most part, the people died in the gardens where they sought relief  from the heat. Those who attempted to run, were overtaken by flows of lava and water, perished under collapsing trees, were suffocated or were burned in the ashfall and the fires. At Kalongan and Tariang, the residents who took refuge in their houses died in the debris. Finally, those who took to the sea shore &#34;fell prey to vicious waves&#34;.</p>',\n",

Serious earthquake shocks are reported as having occurred--writes the Malay Mail&#39;s Sumatra correspondent, in corroboration of a previous telegram--on the islands of Sangi and Talaut, in the residency of Menado. They originated from the volcano, Sahondaroemano, which has been inactive for some time. During the eruptions a huge landslip occurred on Endong mountain The mass measured 150 m in length, 100 in breadth, and was about 3 m in thickness. The kampong at Lesabe, in the Menaloe country was completely engulfed and 117 people were buried alive. The full extent of the damage resulting it is impossible to estimate. A tidal wave, 15 m high, passed over the coast and wrought much havoc. The Government school at Tamaho has been demolished as has the Palace of Raja Toboekan at Emawira. The shocks were of from 4 to 5 min duration. The steamship Flamingo has been sent with assistance from Tomini and is dealing out rice allowances to the destitute native population. A warship is on its way to the scene of the disaster, as many reports are coming to hand of damage done in other small islands near at hand. The Resident of Pasoerlan telegraphs that a shock has been experienced in Kampong Pabras, Probollingo. Five houses were destroyed and two people were buried in the debris. It has not yet been ascertained if they are alive or not.</p>',\n",

Heiser, medical officer at time, estimates deaths at about 2,000. (reference #9675)\\r\\n<p>This increase in volcanic activity coincided with the  first microseismic movements registered in Manila at 20h20m of the 27th. It appears that the explosions began to assume a terrific violence at 1 o&#39;clock in the morning of the 30th. Shortly after 2 a.m. the volcano burst forth with frightful energy. A terrible roar which seemed to be at the same time subterraneous and in the air and could be heard in all directions from the volcano up to distances exceeding 500 km. At the same time there was seen an immense, threatening, black cloud, crossed by brilliant flashes of lightning and illumined by local explosions resembling globular lightning, the whole accompanied by peals of thunder for the space of half an hour. This tempestuous cloud must have risen to an enormous height, since it was observed from distances of some 400 km. \\r\\n</p><p>The chief feature of the eruption seems to have been a terrible explosion which with incredible violence hurled high up into the air and scattered in all directions glowing rocks, earth, mud, ashes, and gases. ..this death-dealing mixture mowed down or destroyed whatever it encountered in its path on the entire island and on the neighboring western shores of Lake Bombon. It cut down or uprooted trees and other plants, destroyed houses, and killed well-nigh every living being within a radius of 5 to 6 km to the east of the crater, and up to more than 15 km to the west thereof. \\r\\n</p><p>Of the 1,300 victims who perished in the 13 small barrios-some on Volcano Island itself, others on the western shore-many were killed in the act of fleeing; others were found buried underneath or among the debris of their huts which had been brought down upon them and torn to pieces, being partially covered with rocks and mud; some\\r\\nseem to have been killed by instantaneous asphyxiation, as they were found on their mats in the attitude of peaceful sleep.\\r\\n</p><p>An idea of the condition in which this region was left by the eruption is given by the report of Col. William C. Rivers, Philippines Constabulary. In this report, written February 5, it is estimated that the number of victims had then already reached 1,295. We quote from it the following passages: The worst stricken district comprises Volcano Island and west side of lake. All vegetation, including trees, destroyed. Country all covered with gray mud hardening under sun present-uniform ashen color. Mud flattened and covers all houses and objects.&#34;\\r\\n</p><p>After returning to Manila on the completion of his special mission, Colonel Rivers presented a final report in which the total number of dead is given as 1,335, that of the injured as 199. This report contains the further statement that 543 nipa houses have been destroyed and 702 head of cattle either drowned or otherwise lost owing to the eruption; the material losses, exclusive of ruined crops, are estimated at F130,159.</p><p>\\r\\nThe exact number of victims will probably never be known-first, because the waves have carried away many corpses and, no doubt, buried others beneath earth, trunks of\\r\\ntrees, and other debris, which filled up many depressions in the ground; secondly, because some have surely met their doom while fleeing toward the jungle, where their bones\\r\\nremained more or less completely buried by the volcanic ashes. Moreover, the number of people who inhabited these regions is by no means known accurately, as they were in the\\r\\nhabit of passing from one village to another according to their convenience in attending to their crops.\\r\\n</p><p>(above from reference #2340)\\r\\n</p><p>1911, Jan 30.

The Vanuatu Geohazards Department raised the alert level for the volcano last week after increased activity at Lombenben&#39;s Manaro Voui crater. Communities in the northwestern and southern parts of Ambae have been worst affected with reports of buildings and trees collapsing under the weight of the ash. Water supplies have also been contaminated and food gardens smothered. The operations manager of the National Disaster Management Office, Peter Korisa, said assessments were still be done and affected communities might be relocated. But he said a longer term solution was needed.

The population returned to their island on the 22 October 2017 after three weeks living in evacuation centres and camps. As of the 8 April, due to a change in wind direction, the North and some parts in the East of Ambae begun reporting heavy ash fall that they described as worse than any other ash fall in the past. Houses, other structures and trees have collapsed under the weight of the ash. Food gardens have been destroyed and water sources contaminated. Furthermore, large fallen trees have blocked road access to some communities in the North, while dangerous landslides believed to be linked to the heavy deposits of ashfall have since destroyed an entire village. The SOE also came with indication of the plan by the National government to assist with voluntary evacuations up until 30 April. After this, they will implement mandatory evacuations over a 2-week period until 15 May.

There were 47 of them padding around rocky Whakaari/White Island at 2.11pm on 9 December, when, without warning, it erupted. The volcano, which rises from the sea 50km off the coast of Whakatāne, spewed steam and rock, and shot ash 3.6km into the air, killing at least eight people and injuring a minimum of 31 others. Eight people are missing, and police say there is no sign of survivors on the island. Of the 47 people who were on Whakaari when it blew, 38 were passengers on the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, which was docked in Tauranga Harbour. (ref #12569)\\r\\n</p><p>Police say another person has died following the Whakaari / White Island eruption bringing the official toll to 15. It is believed 47 people were on or close to Whakaari / White Island when it erupted on Monday. With two people still missing on or around the island after the eruption, that brings the total number of deaths to 17. (ref #12570)\\r\\n</p><p>A Workplace Health and Safety investigation into the Whakaari White Island eruption which has killed 16 and left 26 others in hospital could take a year to complete[...]Fourteen people remain in hospitals around New Zealand, 10 of them are in a critical condition.

(ref #12574)\\r\\n</p><p>The two people whose bodies were still unrecovered after the eruption at Whakaari have been confirmed dead by the Chief Coroner. The announcement brings the official death toll from the eruption on 9 December to 20 people. Several died of their injuries after being rescued from the island. At the time of the eruption, 47 people were on the island including 38 cruise ship passengers.(ref #12582)\\r\\n</p><p>Police have confirmed another person has died as a result of injuries suffered in the eruption on 9 December.

This death brings the official number of people to die from the tragedy to 22. A further 25 people who were on the island at the time survived, but suffered severe injuries as a result of the burns they received. The death of 64-year-old Horst Westenfelder, a German, occurred on 2 July, but was only confirmed yesterday (Thursday) in an official police statement. It is unclear why police waited more than four months to make the announcement. (ref #12811)</p>',\n",

Five climbers who ascended the volcano in the early morning hours of 30 April were killed by the explosion later that day. On 2 May the climbers were found a few hundred meters below the NE crater rim. Their corpses, recovered by Civil Protection authorities, exhibited 3rd-degree burns and severe injuries caused by contusions. Climbing the volcano has been officially prohibited since the current eruption began, and signs were posted at Paso de Cortes. During a helicopter flight on 3 May a depression was observed on the surface of the new dome near the SE inner wall of the main crater.

A thick layer of ash and pumice covered the coast and Saint George&#39;s Channel. At Ghaie, a new cone was formed. A the site of the underwater eruption, a cone-shaped, but rather flat elevation 20 m high formed out of loose material. This later became Raluan (Baluan) Island. The eruption of the Raluan Volcano lasted three days, during which time total darkness reigned; fishes and turtles died. The eruption of the Ghaie Volcano lasted three weeks. Due to the prevailing northwest winds, the ejecta settled mainly in the sea, and on land only the regions immediately adjoining the volcanoes suffered.

About eight o&#39;clock in the morning on Oct 6, 1883, residents of English Harbor heard an explosion and observed dense volumes of smoke rolling from the summit of St. Augustine Volcano. \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2220:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>October 6, 1883. A tsunami was triggered by the sudden displacement of a large volume of seawater from the impact of a debris avalanche at the north shore of St. Augustine Island. This eruption and debris avalanche of St. Augustine Volcano in Cook Inlet, southcentral Alaska traveled ~5 km into the waters of the Cook Inlet. Half of the avalanche travel distance was beyond the pre-1883 shoreline, which was extended to 2 km. \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #239:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>October 6, 1883, 19:04 GMT. Before the eruption on Augustine Island, <b>seven or eight Aleuts had landed to hunt otter during the winter...After the eruption, no trace could be found of the hunters.</b> \\r\\n</p><p>Augustine has had six significant eruptions: 1812, 1883-1884, 1935, 1963-1964, 1976, and 1986. Only the 1883 eruption produced a tsunami.\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2099:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>October 6, 1883. Bathymetry <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?op_0&#61;l&amp;v_0&#61;H09073&amp;t&#61;101523&amp;s&#61;3&amp;d&#61;5&amp;d&#61;10&amp;d&#61;11&amp;d&#61;9&amp;d&#61;12&amp;d&#61;13&amp;d&#61;14&amp;d&#61;15&amp;d&#61;16&amp;d&#61;17&amp;d&#61;18&amp;d&#61;19&amp;no_data&#61;suppress\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><u>(NOAA Hydrographic Survey H-09073)</u></a> indicates that the avalanche traveled an additional 2.5 km beyond the present shoreline. Modeling suggests that the waves traveled at speeds of up to 100 km/hr and generated by the debris avalanche was as much as 30 m high when generated at the leading edge of the debris avalanche and attenuated to heights of 7-9 m as the wave traveled toward the Kenai Peninsula and mainland Alaska. \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #2223:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>The waves inundated houses built along the beaches and carried away fishing boats. Thankfully, the tsunami occurred at low tide minimizing the impact in the Cook Inlet. It is possible that there may have been Aleut casualties during this event (a search for five or six Aleut hunters camped on Augustine Island just prior to the eruption yielded nothing) but the descriptions are unclear; the death designation here is conjectural.\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #4220:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>October 6, 1883. An eyewitness account from English Bay notes minor ash fall occurred at the same time as the tsunami arrived. This ash fall cannot have been a product of the same eruption that generated the tsunami, as ash would have traveled more slowly than the tsunami wave. The minor ash fall at English Bay that began at about the same time as the tsunami lasted only ten minutes and is interpreted as having been generated by a small precursory eruption a few hours before the tsunamigenic events. There are additional accounts of a much larger ashfall starting at 11 am and lasting all day.</p>',\n",

It is important especially for mesoamerican archaeologists, because it had been considered as a stratigraphic boundary between the Preclassic and the Classic horizons. In spite of its importance, two different radiocarbon dates for the eruption were suggested: A. D. 260 ± 114 yr. B. P. (Sheets, 1983) and A. D. 430 with 2 a error range of A. D. 408 to 536 (Dull, et al., 2001)... The resultant AMS radiocarbon dates in this study are very close to the radiocarbon age\\r\\nsuggested by Dull, et al.

       "  'comments': 'Indonesia&#39;s most active volcano, Mount Merapi, has killed over 320 people in a series of eruptions that started on October 26. The first phase of the eruption occurred on Tuesday, October 26, 2010 at 17:00 killing at least 36 people. The eruption was characterized by explosions along with pyroclastic flows that traveled WSW and SE. CVGHM reported that multiple pyroclastic flows occurred until 1854, when the pyroclastic flow activity started to subside. Most of the pyroclastic flows lasted 2 to 9 minutes, except for two that lasted 33 minutes each. The eruption was preceded by an increase in volcanic earthquakes and authorities had been encouraging evacuations, but many remained. The deaths included a 2 month old baby and the volcano&#39;s spiritual leader.\\r\\nBetween Thursday, November 4 and Friday, Nov 5 the volcano erupted killing over 280 people. Dozens are being treated for burns and respiratory problems after a gas cloud hit villages with even greater force than the previous eruptions. Over 300,000 people have been evacuated from the area. As many as 427 victims of the eruption were still treated at hospitals.\\r\\n<p>The eruption has directly affected the rural area and claimed 367 human fatalities, 277 injured, 410,388 evacuated as well as the damaged of infrastructures, houses, live stocks and agriculture areas. The volcanic ash spewed few kilometers above the summit and wind blows the ash endangered the cities and aviation. During the peak of crisis the Airport of Yogyakarta was closed. (reference #11801)\\r\\n</p><p>Loss is estimated at over 600 million US dollars. A large portion of the loss is related to forest devastation which consisted of 1.12 million ruined trees in 2,800 hectares of forest areas, loses in tourism, and damage to fruit plantations.

Subsequent investigations indicate importance of pyroclastic flows in area around Vulcan cone. </p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #414:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>1937, May 28/29. There was an eruption of the Raluan and\\r\\nTawurwur Volcanoes in Blanche Bay. The eruption was accompanied at different stages by oscillations of the water level in the bay.</p><p>The first strong earthquake struck on May 28 at about 13:20. It lasted half a minute and reached a force of 7 degrees (VIII Rossi-Forel)... On May 29, at about 5:30, a new shock was felt at Rabaul... Between 8:00 and 9:00, an elevation of Kaluan Is was observed... \\r\\n</p><p>The eruption of the volcano began at 16:15 [May 29]. The island and the adjacent sections of bottom began to rise quickly; the little islands in the passage began to grow and merge, and soon a broad isthmus formed between the island and the mainland. Then the volcano exploded, and a black pillar of ash and steam 9 m wide and 12 m high rose into the air. The column grew with each subsequent explosion, and reached a height of 3 km. Masses of flames the size of a room or smaller flew up to a height of 1.5 km and then fell to the earth or into the water with A deafening noise. There were no lava flows.\\r\\n</p><p>The eruption of the volcano lasted more than 24 hrs. According to rough estimates, it ejected 0.3 cubic km of material, which spread in the form of ash, mainly to the northwest of the volcano due to the prevailing southeast winds; 60,000,000 cubic m of fresh material was deposited immediately around the volcano under water and 190,000,000 cubic m was deposited above the water level. The height of the island increased from 9 to 200 m. Fields of pumice and ash 1/2 m thick floated in the bay.\\r\\n</p><p>The eruption of the Tawurwur Volcano began on May 30, after 13:00. The eruption lasted until the morning of the following day; about 2,300,000 cubic m of material was ejected. It also settled to the northwest of the volcano, that is, in the region of Rabaul, where the layer of ash was several cm thick.\\r\\n</p><p>During the first explosions of the Raluan Volcano, the underground shocks for the most part stopped. The water near Raluan Is was markedly agitated. At Rabaul, the water retreated 45 m several times, returned to the high high tide mark, and retreated again. Then the eruption was almost continuous for 3 hrs, but there were no noticeable oscillations in level.\\r\\n</p><p>Beginning at 19:00, the eruption began to pulsate, and periods of explosions began to alternate with periods of relative calm. It was precisely, during such a period of calm and before 21:00, that is, before the lip of the new crater of the volcano had completely risen above the water, that considerable oscillations in level were observed in the harbor. Four to five minutes passed between the rise and fall of the water. The amplitude of at least three of these waves was 2-2 1/2 m above and below the mean water level. A schooner was run aground by the wave onto a small pier and then dragged to the depths of the bay together with the pier. Several boats ran aground, and one or two sank. Subsequently, the oscillations apparently diminished, but their range was still 1/2 m early in the morning on the 30th.\\r\\n</p><p> During the eruption, <b>more than 500 people perished, including those who drowned</b>. At Rabaul, two homes and several small ships were destroyed in the rock and ash fall. After the earthquake and eruptions, a stretch of coast from Sulphur Creek to Matupi Island subsided, The\\r\\ndike joining this island with the mainland subsided 1 m.</p>',\n",

       "  'comments': 'In a special bulletin from 0600 on 3 June INSIVUMEH noted increased activity at Fuego. Strong explosions were accompanied by rumbling sounds, and shock waves that vibrated local structures. Dense ash plumes rose 2.3 km above the crater and drifted SW, W, NW, and N. Pyroclastic flows descended the Seca (Santa Teresa) drainage on the W flank, and possibly other drainages, though poor weather conditions prevented clear views of the summit area. Ash plumes drifted in westerly directions, causing ashfall (on roofs and cars).\\r\\n<p>On 5 June INSIVUMEH reported that activity again increased. Explosions occurring at a rate of 8-10/hour, some strong, generated ash plumes that rose 5 km and drifted E and NE.

The number of missing after Volcán del Fuego&#39;s eruption was unclear, said the authorities from Guatemala&#39;s natural disaster commission, known as Conred. The volcano, which sits less than 30 miles from the capital, Guatemala City, erupted just before noon Sunday and continued to spew ash, rocks and gas into the air. A second powerful eruption followed at 6:45 p.m. Some two million people were affected by the volcano&#39;s ash, which billowed 15,000 feet into the air and dispersed over a nine-mile radius. More than 3,200 people were evacuated, and at least 46 people were injured, some of them with severe burns. More than 1,600 were in shelters.

       "  'comments': 'Colin Scott and his sister, Sable, came Tuesday for the mesmerizing hot springs, a favorite sightseeing stop for millions of tourists each year at Yellowstone National Park, in Wyoming, where mineral deposits tint crystal-clear pools of steaming water brilliant shades of blue, green, orange and yellow. The siblings, from Oregon, were exploring the Norris Geyser Basin, officials said, the park\\x92s oldest and hottest thermal area, when they deviated from the boardwalk that hovers safely aboveground and took their adventure off course. They walked 225 yards away from the boardwalk and into an isolated area, officials said, only a thin, feeble crust of earth separating their feet from the acidic water bubbling beneath. Then, somehow, Colin Scott slipped, and as his sister watched, the 23-year-old tumbled into one of the boiling springs. Despite her immediate call for help and the prolonged search efforts by park staff, her brother was never seen again. His flip-flops, reported NBC News, were one of the few things rescuers retrieved. They halted their recovery mission Wednesday, park spokeswoman Charissa Reid told the Associated Press, &#34;due to the extreme nature and futility of it all.&#34; The water was highly acidic, Reid said, leaving &#34;no remains left to recover.&#34; (reference #11744)',\n",

On Tuesday, one flow hit a group of sand miners on the banks of the Gendol River, killing one person, injuring another and sweeping away several trucks...\\r\\n&#34;The danger on Merapi right now is only related to rain [mixing with] all the material that erupted in 2010,&#34; Agus Hendratno, a geologist and lecturer at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, told The Wall Street Journal on Friday. &#34;An early warning system was developed for the threat of mudflows, but sand miners often pay little heed to the warning.&#34; Hundreds of laborers work along the mountain\\x92s rivers each day to gather sand for cement production. Many excavate by hand...

In addition, numerous cattle were affected. The most severe damage extended from the volcano to the city of León. Primary damage to home, commercial, and industrial infrastructure, estimated at $3,000,000, was mostly caused by roof collapse on the first day of the eruption. As of 15 April, there were no reports of injuries directly related to the eruption. The 50 indirectly related injuries occurred predominantly during evacuations, and from falls as people cleaned their roofs; 1-2 people died from falls.

(reference #9675)\\r\\n<p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #414:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>1871, March 3. On Tahulandang Island, from about the middle of February the residents of the island began to feel underground shocks. On March 2, chunks of stone began to roll down from the top of Ruang Volcano, standing in the sea 300 m from the island. On the 3rd at about 20:00 [local time], an earthquake began suddenly, and at the same time a thunderous rumble &#34;announced&#34; the eruption of the volcano. </p><p>A few seconds later, an enormous wave surged onto the coast of Tahulandang Island. It penetrated 180 m inland, and destroyed all the huts and plantations in its path. At the center of Tahulandang (Buhias) settlement, a wave rose 25 m above the usual sea level, as was determined by an official who investigated the island on March 30-31, from objects which caught on some trees which survived the waves. Two more waves followed the first wave at very short intervals.\\r\\n</p><p>Of the fluorishing settlement, consisting of 75 homes, there remained only three huts on its northern margin. However, they were all heavily damaged, and only one remained suitable for habitation; in addition, all the outbuildings and utensils kept under the huts were washed off. All the other homes were overturned and smashed or washed away, including a well-built church with stone walls 0.5 m thick. Bits of masonry were scattered around for a distance of up to 100 m, so that only the remaining paved courtyard indicated the previous site of the church. The earth was furrowed with ditches, carved out by the retreating water. The trees were uprooted and strewn helter-skelter with debris of homes and various utensils. A small ship was tossed to the foot of the mountain. The plantations situated on the mountain side remained intact. Out of the 500 residents of the settlement, 277 died.\\r\\n</p><p>Other settlements on the western and southwestern shore of the island also suffered destruction (Bohoi, Tulusan, Haasi). In all, about 400 people died on the island.\\r\\n</p><p>All the plantations and in general all the vegetation on the slopes of the Ruang Volcano were also destroyed. From 20:00 on March 9 to 14:00 on the 10th, there was a recurrent eruption of the volcano; sand and stones were ejected. Then the eruption resumed on March 14 and continued until 3:00.</p>',\n",

Its initial eruption produced a plume of volcanic ash and steam that rose nearly 17 kilometers high. Winds carried the plume east, over the Andes Mountains and into Argentina. The plume then drifted out over the over the Atlantic Ocean. It was visible on satellite images for hundreds of kilometers over the Atlantic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe town of Chaiten, located about 10 kilometers southwest of the eruption site, was blanketed with ash. About 4,000 people who lived there were evacuated by boat. One elderly person died during the evacuation efforts. On 6 May, the eruption became more forceful and generated a wider and darker gray ash plume to an estimated altitude of 30 km (98,400 ft) a.s.l.

The sky was illuminated like day-time. A little later, people, panic-stricken by the violent trembling, were lying on the ground; some were buried under fallen houses and others inside wide-opened ground fissures, while horses and cows desperately ran about and trampled each other. A number of castles, towers, and other tall structures collapsed. Then roarings like thunder were heard towards the sea. The sea soon rushed into the villages and towns, over-whelming a few hundred miles of land along the coast. There was scarcely any time for escape, though there were boats and the high ground just before them. In this way about 1000 people were killed. Hundreds of hamlets and villages were left in ruins.&#34; (Imamura, 1934). This earthquake is suggested to be one of the predecessors of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (e.g., Sawai et al., 2015). The magnitude and source region of the 869 earthquake were re-evaluated (e.g., Sugawara et al., 2012; Namegaya and Satake, 2014) using the insights obtained from the 2011 tsunami.

In 3-4 minutes the capital was completely destroyed. The port of Callao suffered most of all from this catastrophe. Like Lima, Callao consisted mostly of single-storey houses on a low-terrace, whose height was no greater than 3 m (9-10 feet) above the high water mark. The town was enclosed by a fortress wall, whose base was sometimes washed by the strong ocean tides. Normally, the water level at Callao rises 1.4 m (4-5 feet). Up to 5000 persons lived in the town. Callao was damaged by the earthquake to the same degree as Lima. Approximately one half hour after the earthquake, the ocean &#34;swelled&#34;, rose approximately 10 m, smashed the city wall and inundated the city. When the water receded the majority of houses and other buildings were dislodged from their foundations and washed away. A sizeable portion of the city wall, including the gate, had been carried away by the water. Almost the entire population of the town perished in this disaster. Since the water advanced 4 km inland, it overtook even those who had tried to flee to Lima. Only about 200 persons managed to save themselves by clasping onto wooden objects which were being tossed about between the shore area and the island of San Lorenzo, a distance of more than 8 km away. (reference #415)</p><p>In Callao 6000 people were killed by the tsunami and 19 ships including warships were destroyed. (reference #1102)</p><p>The city of Callao was destroyed by two waves, one of which was 80 feet high. All the ships in the harbor were either destroyed or washed ashore. Destructive waves also reported from Cavallos, Cuanape, Changay, and Guara. (reference #39)</p><p>&#34;The Lima wave finished the destruction of Callao already begun by the earthquake. The sea retired slowly and returned with a roar. It swept everything before it. There were 23 ships in port mostly crushed and sunk, but the largest were carried beyond the walls of the city, four vessels, and left in the fields.&#34; (reference #3903)</p><p><i>Note: Ref#12938 discusses the claims of the tsunami affecting the island of Tenerife (Spain) in the Atlantic are highly questionable.</i></p>',\n",

       "  'comments': 'On August 11, 1749, began one of the most violent outbursts of Taal on record. It has been described by Fr. Buencuchillo, 0.S.A., an eye-witness, since he was at the\\r\\ntime parish-priest of Sala. During the night of that day the top of the mountain burst out with tremendous force from the same crater which since ancient times used to emit fire and rocks. The course of events was this: <p>\\r\\n...I noticed that also from the water there arose enormous columns of sand and ashes, which ascended in the shape of pyramids to marvelous heights and then fell back into the lake like illuminated fountains.</p><p>Some of the pyramids surged toward north, others toward east, the sight lasting until 9 o&#39;clock of the morning. At the latter hour there was felt a furious earthquake which left nothing moveable in\\r\\nits place within the convento. This forced me to flee to higher ground, especially as I noticed that some of the horrid pyramids shooting forth from the water were coming toward the town and place where we were. When they reached that part of the lake&#39;s shore which was known as &#34;tierra destruida&#34; [waste land?], they ruined that tract entirely, and with a second earthquake, not less fierce than the one\\r\\nshortly preceding, it sank into the lake. To this very day, the branches of the trees buried beneath the water can be seen from the distance. </p><p>During these terrible convulsions of the earth fissures opened in the ground amid horrifying roars, said fissures extending from the northern and northeastern beach of the lake as far as the neighborhood of the town of Calamba. Here as well as elsewhere, the whole shore of Lake Bombon has been disturbed. The entire territory of Sala and part of that of Tanauan have been rendered practically uninhabitable-the water courses have been altered, former springs have ceased to flow and new ones made their appearance, the whole country is traversed by fissures, and extensive subsidences have occurred in many places. </p><p>Sala and its surroundings to the northeast of the lake, as well as, a portion of the territory of Tanauan, which is north of it, were so thoroughly ruined and, consequently, depopulated that within the same year, 1749, the former was united with the latter town.\\r\\n</p><p>(above from reference #2340)\\r\\n</p><p>[...]the origin of the waves observed during the 1749 eruption remains unclear. This violent phreatomagmatic eruption (VEI 4) lasted three months and severely impacted the northern and northeastern shores of the lake (Delos Reyes et al. 2018). One earthquake led to land subsidence in the northeastern part of the caldera (near Tanauan). Explosions were located in the main crater of Taal Island (Fig. 1), with a possible extension to coastal or sublacustrine vents near the northeastern point of the island. (reference#12533)</p>',\n",

There was a destructive earthquake on the southwest of the Philippine Islands, with a maximum intensity of VIII (IX Rossi-Forel). \\r\\n</p><p>The steamship &#34;Brutus&#34;, situated near Zamboanga, felt a strong seaquake. Waves arose, moving to the east and breaking on shore near Zamboanga about 10 minutes later.\\r\\n</p><p>At Zamboanga, about 15:00 (local time), an earthquake recurred with the same force as the preceding one.\\r\\nThen a phenomenon occurred which caused great panic. The sea level fell 5 m, and then rose and fell with great speed. After several such oscillations in level, sea waves began to flood the city, although they did not advance further than the first few homes. The water picked up proas riding off shore and left them high and dry. According to eyewitnesses, the greatest oscillations in level were observed from 15:00 to 16:00, and at 16:00, the second of the strongest waves arrived. The phenomenon lasted a little less than 2 hours.\\r\\n</p><p>At Isabela, about half an hour after the earthquake, water burst with a roar into the northeastern passage leading to the port. The enormous waves moving from the west washed away everything on shore; the sea level rose at least 7 m above the usual mark. The sea rose and fell more than 30 times, and one of the waves was considerably larger than the others. The waves broke on shore with such force that they easily rolled building timber 6 m long and pieces of masonry. A grocery store was washed away, 25 homes were destroyed, and the gunboat General Laso was imperiled.\\r\\n</p><p>There were victims on the farms of the Moro tribe: at Panigayan, two injured: at Balauan, five dead, six injured; at Labotan, three dead, six injured; at Matiban, five dead, homes destroyed; eight homes were washed away at Tagu.\\r\\n</p><p>An eyewitness on a boat riding at anchor in Sibuguey Bay, related that the water raised the boat together with its two anchors several times and the ship was in great danger.\\r\\n</p><p>At Dapitan Port, the sea rose 2 m at the head of the bay.\\r\\n</p><p>At Negros Island, at noon a boat was crossing the bay; its movements were almost totally paralyzed by the waves.\\r\\n</p><p>On Jolo Island, 15 minutes after the earthquake, the sea began to rise and fall at 15 minute intervals, retreating 200-250 m from shore. The maximum height of rise of water was 1 m. The rough sea calmed by 21:30 (L.T.).\\r\\n</p><p>On Siau Island, Indonesia, the first drop in level was observed 1.5 hours after the earthquake. In 1/2 hour, the water retreated far beyond the ebb tide mark. Then it returned, reaching the flood tide mark in a few minutes. </p><p>Tsunami reports also came from the north coast of Calimantan island (Kudat region) and from the eastern shore of Sumatra Island.\\r\\n</p><p>Between Labuan Island and the coast of Calimantan Island, where the depth of the water had been 6 m, a new little island quietly rose out of the water after 13:00 on the 21st. The island was made up of clay and pebbles and was 200 m long, 150 m wide, and 20 m high. Its surface gave off hot gases and there was  a strong petroleum smell. It is possible that the island was built up by the tsunami waves; on the other hand, the island could have also been the result of an underwater mud eruption.\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1072:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>A tsunami claimed claimed hundreds of victims on the western shores of Basilan. \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1058:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>100 victims due to the tsunami.</p>',\n",

A tsunami, which did not do great damage, was observed on the coast of Hokkaido Island and the Sanriku coast after the earthquake. The limited damage is partly explained by the fact that the tsunami coincided with the ebb tide phase. The protective works built after the Chilean tsunami of 1960 also played a large role. The waves had a height of 1-2 m on the south coast of Hokkaido Island, and 2-5 m in the regions of Tokachi and Hidaka. The tsunami also reached a height of 5 m in places on the Sanriku coast.\\r\\n</p><p>The tsunami was observed by tide gauges in Japan and throughout the Pacific Basin in Mexico, Russia, the Marshall Islands, Alaska, California, and Hawaii. \\r\\n</p><p>As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, 52 people died and 329 people were injured; 676 homes were completely destroyed and 2,994 homes were half destroyed; 13 homes burned down and 529 homes were flooded; 97 ships were washed away and 30 were sunk. In addition, roads, bridges and protective dikes were destroyed. The total damage was estimated at least at 130 million dollars. \\r\\n</p><p>The mean displacement of the surface of the sea at the source has been estimated by Abe at &#43;82 cm in the zone of elevations, and -20 cm in the the zone of subsidences. Aida estimated the maximal initial rise of water at 5 m, the drop at 2 m, and the energy of the tsunami at 4 X 10<sup>20</sup> ergs. The maximum radiation of the tsunami, according to his calculations, was directed along the minor axis of the source, while more long-period oscillations radiated out along the major axis. \\r\\n</p><p>View a calculated <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu_travel_time.shtml#Honshu1968\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tsunami-travel-time map</a>.</p>',\n",

There were 140 people\\r\\ninjured in Japan, including one woman whose car plunged off a collapsed bridge and one man who died of a heart attack. The earthquake generated a tsunami with a height of 4.5-6.0 m at the southern part of Dimitrova Bay, Shikotan Island and 3.0-7.1 meters at Tserkovnaya Bay indicating multiple\\r\\nwaves in the tsunami. Evidence of four separate runup heights also indicates a multiple wave attack.\\r\\n<p>On the west side of the island the height at Malo-kurilskaya was one to two meters. The tide gage\\r\\nindicated a subsidence of 53 cm. Eyewitnesses reported the initial wave to be a rise as was confirmed by the marigrams that also showed periods of about 20 minutes. Elsewhere on the island the heights were measured from <b>8.5 meters at Tserkovnaya Bay</b> to 2.6 meters. On Kunashiri Island\\r\\nthe maximum height was surveyed at 5.3 meters at Petrova Point. On Iturup Island the maximum height was 3.4 meters and on Polonsky Island the maximum height was 4 meters.\\r\\n</p><p>At Yuzhno-Kurilsk the heights ranged from 2.5-3.0 meters. In the older part of the town, waves penetrated 200 to 300 meters on the gentle, sloping beach damaging all houses. The wave penetrated 500 meters along the river destroying two bridges and washing away two homes dragging another 300 meters. All moorings were destroyed and two 300-ton fishing boats, five pontoons, and several motorboats were thrown on dry land. None of the fatalities were due to the tsunami as the maximum heights were 1.5-2.0 meters in populated areas. This was fortunate since a warning could not be sent to the area due to the disrupted communications caused by the earthquake.\\r\\n</p><p>(above from reference #1315)\\r\\n</p><p>Maximum runup height of 10.4 m at the southern part of Dimitrova Bay.

Tonggolobibi is located only 14 kilometers from the epicenter that was a back arc event with deep thrusting. The <b>tsunami destroyed 183 houses</b> and damaged 228 units in the Bangkir-Tolitoli area. It affected about 100 kilometers of the coast but there were no reports of tsunami data being recorded outside of Sulawesi. The land subsided by about one meter. It occurred at high tide. As the wave arrival times were very short, (about five minutes after the earthquake) and several sites reported an initial withdrawal, some of the wave action may have been due to tsunami induced landslides. Breaking waves were also reported at about half of the sites. Three waves were observed. The wave penetrated as much as 200 meters up riverbeds and carried five boats including two 500-ton motorboats 250 meters on shore. Since the tsunami occurred at a high tide of 59 cm, and there was a subsidence of the land of about 70 cm, it was difficult to estimate the wave heights. (reference #1315)\\r\\n<p>In the Donggala regency, the most heavily damaged area\\r\\nwas Tongglolbibi village which belongs to the Dempelas\\r\\nSojol district. The tsunami attacked the village about 5\\r\\nminutes after the earthquake. The tsunami was reported to\\r\\n<b>runup 3-5m</b> and extend about 300m inland. A house\\r\\ndrifted 10m from its original foundation, and two 500-ton\\r\\nmotor boats drifted 250m ashore.

Devastation from the tsunami occurred along northern Crete, western Cyprus, and the eastern Mediterranean as far as the Syrian coasts. Estimates of height of the tsunami vary from 40 to 90 m.

The day he reached Luckput there were shocks of an earthquake, which shook down part of the walls of the fort, and some lives were lost. At the same time as the shock the sea rolled up the Koree (the eastern) mouth of the Indus, overflowing the country as far westward as the Goongra river (a distance of twenty English miles), northward as far as a little north of Veyre (forty miles from the mouth of the Koree), and eastward to the Sindree\\r\\nLake. The guide was detained six days (from June 19th to 25th), during which time sixty-six shocks were counted. He then got across to Kotree, of which only a few small buildings on a bit of rising ground remained. Most of the habitations throughout the district must have been swept away, the best houses in Scinde being built of sun-dried bricks, and whole villages consisting only of huts made of a few crooked poles and reed mats. The guide traveled\\r\\ntwenty miles through water on a camel, the water up to the beast&#39;s body. Of Lak nothing was above water but a Fakeer&#39;s pole (the flagstaff always erected by the tomb of some holy man); and of Veyre and other villages only the remains of a few houses were to be seen.\\r\\n</p><p>&#34; There are said to be generally two earthquakes every year at Luckput.

The natives told me that during my absence they had experienced on the coast and the mountains several earthquakes, on which occasions some natives were killed by the falling of cocoanut trees in the villages, which in falling destroyed the huts. The villages on the coast suffered more on account of unusually big waves which followed soon after the earthquake, breaking down the cocoanut trees and sweeping away a few huts nearest to the beach. In revisiting the coast villages, I found many not unimportant changes: stretches of destroyed forest by tidal waves after the earthquake; alteration in the direction of some small streams, the old mouths of which had been closed by bars of sand left behind by waves.

This is a very short time for the tsunami travel time from the tsunami landslides scars proposed by Ratzov et al, 2007, and also for the fault plane for the similar 1942 earthquake, as it is demonstrated in Ioualalen et al, 2011.

       "  'comments': 'A small- to moderate-size tsunami was generated by the September 7th earthquake, and detected along the Pacific coast in the region of the earthquake. According to initial water-level measurements by Stuart Weinstein of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) (via the International Tsunami Bulletin Board), the tsunami was recorded on several tide gauges in southern Mexico and El Salvador. Based on this information, the largest tsunami amplitudes occurred during the first five hours of the observed arrival times at each tide gauge except for the El Salvador location, where the peak occurred 14 hours after first arrival. Videos posted on Youtube indicate that there was minor flooding along the waterfront of the harbor at Puerto Chiapas. In the far field, the maximum tsunami amplitudes from this event were all less than 0.35m, which was the measured amplitude in Owenga, Chatham Islands, in New Zealand (PTWC). (reference #11912)\\r\\n<p>The associated tsunami waves were recorded first at Huatulco tide gauge station at 5:04 (GMT) 12 min after the earthquake. We covered ground observations along 41 km of the coast of Chiapas, encompassing the sites with the highest projected wave heights based on our preliminary tsunami model (maximum tsunami amplitudes between 94.5 and 93.0W). Runup and inundation distances were measured along eight sites. The tsunami occurred at low tide. The maximum runup was ~3 m at Boca del Cielo, and maximum inundation distance was 190 m in Puerto Arista, corresponding to the coast in front of the epicenter and in the central sector of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Tsunami scour and erosion was evident along the Chiapas coast. Tsunami deposits, mainly sand, reached up to 32 cm thickness thinning landward up to 172 m distance. (reference #11983)</p>',\n",

Later Sunday morning, police said that four people missing and 11 buildings were washed into the sea by the tsunami. Arctic Command published pictures of the mountain at Karrat Ice Fjord, where there has been a huge shift. An area of about 300 times 1100 meters crashed into the sea. According Arctic Command it is probably the cause of the tsunami on Saturday night.

However, in the aftermath of the event, scientists have examined the event more carefully, and have now determined that there was no earthquake. Instead, the landslide was so large that it generated significant seismic energy. Two clues that led scientists to see that there had in fact been no earthquake were the duration and characteristic of the seismic signals. Not only did the seismic waves last for approximately five minutes, but they were monochromatic and slowly increased in amplitude (the highest amplitude waves lasted about 30 seconds). Such traits, according to the IRIS blog, authored by John Clinton (ETH Zurich), Tine Larsen, Trine Dahl-Jensen, Peter Voss (GEUS Copenhagen), and Meredith Nettles (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University) are &#34;indicative of complex landslide signals.&#34; (ref #11836)\\r\\n</p><p>The team, including the acclaimed environmental scientist Hermann Fritz, has estimated that the wave at the coast where the landslide struck reached a marked 90 meters altitude.

It was the strongest explosion in historical times in Indonesia. It was accompanied by considerable oscillations in sea level. The eruption began on April 1. At 22:00 [local time] at Bajuwangi (Java Island), a cannonade boomed out like peals of distant thunder. It was repeated from time to time, and this continued until 9:00 on the 2nd. On the morning of the 3rd, a light fall of ashes began; on the 5th, explosions began to be heard at 1/4 hour intervals.\\r\\n</p><p>The eruption reached its peak on the evening of the 10th, when a colossal pillar of smoke rose above the volcano and the entire mountain seemed to eject flame. Soon the volcano and all that occurred there were hidden in a dense cloud of smoke. \\r\\n</p><p>The sound of a shot was so loud that it was heard for an enormous distance: from Bengkulu and Banka Island in the west to Ternate Island in the east. At Surabaja, the air wave uprooted trees, destroyed the walls of homes, and bowled over people and animals. The tremors were felt more or less strongly at Banjuwangi, Sumenep, Surakarta, Rembang, apparently on the southeast of Kalimantan Island, at Makassar and on Flores Island.\\r\\n</p><p><b>Scorching hot slag and ashes covered all of Sumbawa Island and a sizeable water area. Buildings collapsed under this load. The previously picturesque island was turned into a desolate desert. Of 12,000 residents, only 26 survived.</b> On neighboring Lombok Island, the depth of the layer of ashes was 0.5 m. A similar layer of ashes was floating at sea west of Sumbawa Island on the 12th. On Java Island, the ashfall was so dense that complete darkness set in. The ashes fell on Java at a distance of 550 km from the volcano; it also fell on Sulawesi Island at Ambon. From this one can conclude that the ash was ejected to a very great height, as otherwise it would have been carried by the trade winds only to the west.\\r\\n</p><p>On the 10th, with still weather, the sea off the coast of Sumbawa Island suddenly rose to a height of 0.5 to 3.5 m. Large waves burst into the estuaries of the rivers and immediately surged back. Here and there homes and trees were washed away. At Bima, the water submerged the floors of homes by 0.3 m. All the proas and boats were torn from their anchors and tossed onshore. The coast at the Tambora volcano subsided so that water 5-6 m deep appeared in place of the land.\\r\\n</p><p>Short-period (duration no more than 3 minutes) oscillations in level were noted on Sulawesi and Java Islands. At Sumenep, on the 11th at 19:00 during an ebb tide, a flood tide of water from the bay made the river rise 1-1.5 m; then the level fell for 4 minutes.\\r\\n</p><p>The explosions of the volcano, which were accompanied by strong tremors, lasted several more days.

Many of the fatalities occurred when tsunami capsized boats filled with fleeing residents. Newspaper and other reports suggesting 3,000-5,000 deaths are very unreliable. (reference #9675)\\r\\n<p>A moderately violent phreatomagmatic explosive eruption of Taal Volcano, in the Philippines, occurred from 28 to 30 September 1965. The main phreatic explosions, which were preceded by ejection of basaltic spatter, opened a new crater 1.5 kilometers long and 0.3 kilometer wide on the southwest side of Volcano Island in Lake Taal. The eruption covered an area of about 60 square kilometers with a blanket of ash more than 25 centimeters thick and killed approximately 190 persons. ..\\r\\n</p><p>The explosions within the crater area produced shock waves that generated water waves, which probably reached\\r\\nmaximum height between Volcano Island and the west shore of Lake Taal. These waves capsized some of the boats filled with the fleeing residents of the island and accounted for many of the fatalities. The maximum height of the waves is not known, because evidence of wave height during the early, most violent phase of the eruption is now covered by layers of ash. However, on the west shore of Lake Taal, directly west of the mouth of the explosion crater, there is clear evidence that waves reached 4.7 meters above lake\\r\\nlevel and swept inshore as much as 80 meters. The debris left by these waves is on top of the air-fall ash, hence the waves must have occurred very late in the eruption. Undoubtedly much larger waves swept that coast earlier. \\r\\n</p><p>A streamflow gage 1.5 kilometers downstream from the outlet of Lake Taal shows an increase of flow from an average of 20,500 liters per second for several days before the eruption to a maximum of 28,400 liters per second on 28 September, followed by decreases to 23,800 liters per second\\r\\non 29 September, and 22,800 liters per second on 30 September. Such an increase is probably due to excessive\\r\\nwave action and to seiches produced by the explosion shock waves, as well as to displacement of water by the ash fall and to the inordinately heavy rain that accompanied the eruption.\\r\\n</p><p>(above from reference #5094)\\r\\n</p><p>Many of the 190-355 fatalities occurred when tsunami waves capsized boats containing residents fleeing from Taal Island to the western shore of the lake (near Agoncillo).

There was a multiple eruption of the Miyejin submarine volcano (31 deg 56.7 min N., 140 deg 0.5 min E.) 130 km south of Hachijo Island. The augite-hypersthene-dacite composition of the lavas determined the explosive nature of the eruptions. All the explosions were well recorded by the hydrophones of the American SOFAR system, including those on the coast of California. Some of the eruptions were observed visually from ships and airplanes by Japanese specialists. Thus, during the weak eruption of September 23 at 13h 40m, a water dome, with protuberances 600-800 m high and 2 km in diameter, arose over the volcano. No seaquake was felt , but waves 50 m long and 2 m high spread over the sea surface. During the stronger eruptions weak tsunamis were generated, 52 of which were registered by the tide gauge on Hachijo Island. The strongest of these waves were also registered by tide gauges on Jogashima Island and Cape Omae on the south coast of Japan. The travel time of the waves to Hachijo Island was about 30 minutes, the period 1.5 minutes, the height 10-90 cm. In the nature of dispersion and other parameters, the waves corresponded to theoretical Cauchy-Poisson waves from an initial impulse with a source diameter of 2 &#43; km. Some waves were like pulses. This was apparently due to the interference of waves bending around both sides of Aoga-shima Island, midway between the volcano and Hachijo Island.</p><p>The tsunami of September 26 was recorded in Hilo, in the Hawailan Islands with an amplitude of less than 0.1 m.</p><p>The ship &#34;Kiyo Maru No 5&#34; of the Japanese hydrographic service, which had come out to study the eruption, was lost in the eruption of September 24.</p></blockquote>',\n",

The tsunami wave started with a large drop in water level; ships were left high &amp; dry; many sea animals were beached; citizens rushed to the exposed shore to pick up fish with their hands. About 15min later a large wave appeared with a roar, sweeping everything in its path. This turned out to be unexpected for the many thousand people crowding the coast and resulted in their death. Broken ships were found 2km from the coastal line on the southwestern shore of Pelponnesus near Methone. Achaea &amp; other districts (Boeotia, Epirus) in the north of Pelponnesus were damaged. About <strong>5000 people were killed in Greece</strong>.<br />In the northern part of the Adriatic Sea, rivers flowed backwards; the sea retreated from the coastal line.

In the region of the lagoon of al-Manzala, east of the Delta between Damietta and Port Said, the land previously rich became a desert:...the sea rose suddenly due to the earthquake, rushing over its limits, ruining all villages, covering with salt the land which before was fertile...only villages on high ground survived. Later writers add that in Alexandria alone <strong>50000 houses were flooded and 5000 people were drowned</strong>; ships were carried by the waves over the city walls and boats in the Nile were deposited on dry land about 3.5km from river. The region of Tinnis and the town itself were totally destroyed. The sea-wave had equally destructive effects in other parts of the eastern Mediterranean region...more likely that the damaging effects of the earthquake were confined between Messenia and Laconia in the Peloponnese, the west part of Crete and Cyrenaiea, but not further west.(ref #3845)</p><p>365 July 21. 35N 23E, magnitude 8, intensity X, tsunami intensity VI.

On 18 September 1601, central Switzerland was hit by one of the largest known earthquakes in central Europe (I &#61; VII-VIII, Mw - 6.2; Swiss Seismological Service, 2002). Several towers in Lucerne were destroyed, and Renward Cysat, the registrar of Lucerne at that time, reported in his chronicle, &#34;What scared people most was that the out flowing river Reuss flowed back into Lake Lucerne so that the riverbed between the two parts of the city almost became dry and several people\\r\\ncould cross it by foot, before the water again vehemently advanced towards the city&#34; (Cysat, 1601, p. 884). As Cysat traveled along the lake&#39;s shore, he recorded observations such as: &#34;Ships had been thrown onshore ... up to two halberds [~4 m] aboye the lake level. ... Small islands and shoals had disappeared,&#34; (p. 883) as did &#34;entire houses with sleeping people&#34; (Cysat, 1601, p. 887). In Lucerne, the cyclic oscillation of lake level (seiche) had a period of 10 min and an estimated amplitude of 1-2 m (Cysat, 1601; Siegenthaler et al., 1987). An earthquake of this magnitude could not have directly caused such massive water movements that lasted several hours. In fact, Siegenthaler et al. (1987) linked these large-scale water movements of A.D. 1601 to two large slump deposits in the subsurface of Lake Lucerne.',\n",

There was an earthquake (17 S 72 W, mag 8.5) and tsunami in Peru and in the northern part of Chile. The tsunami flooded the coastline for a distance of 1200 km. Arica suffered most of all. According to a report of the governor of Arica, the ocean receded a distance of two musket shots further than its normal low water point, and then, while the tremors were still occurring, raged with such force that it covered the islet of Alacran, situated opposite the high part of the city. A barrack-type building (wooden or adobe) was carried away with this first wave. The second shock, which occurred 15 minutes after the first ebb, caused the water to recede again, only to reappear in rising form, sweeping the town and carrying away warehouses, stores, and a large church, and advancing another 100 m inland and destroying all houses. Subsequently, the water receded to the point where the anchors of all ships were exposed... Three persons drowned in Arica itself, and more than twenty along the coast... In Ilo, the water rose to a point where it advanced almost 2 km inland along a valley uprooting 100-year old fig trees. Eleven indians were drowned... Three high tides and ebbs were reported to have occurred in Camana. The water advanced along a valley for more than 2 km destroying everything in its path. Forty persons were washed away and drowned. \\r\\n<p>1705, November 26 (or 16). An earthquake occurred in Arequipa and Arica, and the wave generated during that quake flooded and destroyed a large part of Arica.

First Arica Earthquake. (Arica was probably affected by earlier earthquakes, such as the great Arequipa, Peru, earthquake of January 22, 1582; but no documents exist.) The exact date is given in an inventory of military supplies salvaged\\r\\nfrom the tsunami, dated December 5, 1604 and signed by the\\r\\nCorregidor of Arica. The port of Arica, formerly located near the center of the bay, was completely destroyed by the tsunami and the town was rebuilt at its present location, close to the famous Rock or &#34;Morro&#34; of Arica. Arequipa, in the Peruvian interior at a distance of about 260 km, was almost completely destroyed; only the convent of San Francisco remained standing. People were thrown to the ground by the earthquake; the losses were estimated at more than a million gold pesos. The tsunami is not accurately described, but it is known that at least three successive waves flooded the coast line along an extension of 300 &#34;leguas&#34;, or 1200 km. The Peruvian port of Pisco more than 800 km northwest of Arica, was damaged by the tsunami according to one report. Damage from the tsunami extended across the Pacific Ocean. The effects of this great earthquake, as far as they are known, were similar to those of the great Arica earthquake of August 13, 1868. The\\r\\nmagnitude is estimated at 8 1/4-8 1/2.

Five very strong earthquakes occurred in a short interval of time (February-March), causing destructions and a lot of victims in a vast region embracing the whole southern Calabria and the Messina area, Sicily.  The 5 February [12hr] earthquake abruptly opened the seismic period. More than 380 villages damaged, 180 almost totally ruined. More than 25,000 victims, mostly because of the violent fire following the shock. \\r\\n<p>Coast from Messina to Torre del Faro (about 11 miles) and from Cenidio to Scilla (about 7 miles) heavily affected by the tsunami. Sea generally reported to recede and then to inundate the shore. Withdrawals and inundations repeated at least three times at intervals of about 10-15 min. At Joppolo a cosiderable sea withdrawal was observed leaving sea bottom dried. In the sea between Nicotera and Gioa Tauro, two waves seen to form by two fishermen: one travelled toward Capo Vaticano and the other toward Gioia del Tirreno. This was as high as a big vessel, but caused no damage. Probably the same fact reported occurring about 8 minutes after the shock. At Nicotera where two big waves were observed to form offshore: one heading toward the coast, the other travelling seaward. At Nicotera the sea withdrew boiling and then turned the fishing-boats upside-down. At Gioa del Tirreno the sea inundated the shore without any damage. At Scilla the sea withdrew for more than 10 meters leaving the sea bottom dry and a lot of fish on the beach; then suddenly the water came back surpassing its usual limit of about 1,5 meters and flooding the coast. Oscillation repeated with period of 15 minutes. \\r\\nAt Messina the sea overpassed the quays, destroying them, and violently inundated the theathre Marittimo. Sea agitated for three days after the main shock. At Torre del Faro, sea retreat followed by inundation observed. The water of the two marshes, Pantano Piccolo and Pantano Grande, receded). The sea coming back, partly destroyed the lighthouse and penetreted as far as the two marshes, inundating wineyards, then withdrew dragging many boats livestock and leaving fish on shore. The sea receding dragged some fishermen. At Catona the sea flooded the coast for a short stretch. At Reggio Calabria the sea surpassed the beach arriving at the coastal road inundating some twon district. At San Gregorio a rockfall fell into the sea generating sea waves. In the stretch of coast from Bianco to Roccella Ionica (about 35 km long) the beach was flooded by about one mile. At Roccella the wave was observed about 7 minutes after the shock. The sea reached the monastery of the Minims Paolotti carrying many boats onland.\\r\\n</p><p>Simulated numerically by Tinti (ref #1407).\\r\\n<br />Revisions: Graziani (ref #3954), Tinti (ref #2761).</p>',\n",

The inhabitants, panic-stricken, abandoned their homes and families and are still living in the open air, fearing a repetition of the shocks. In the neighborhood of Port Limon four small islands disappeared. These islands were inhabited by fishermen, who escaped in small boats, which they were at sea for three days, until the water became sufficiently calm to enable them to reach the mainland. The city of Esmeraldas was nearly inundated by a tidal wave which entered the port, flooding the principal streets. All the inhabitants ran for the mountains in the neighborhood. All the towns in the provinces of Esmeraldas and Manabi were greatly damaged. Most of the inhabitants are homeless.

A catastrophic earthquake (intensity&#61;XI), preceded by a strong shock of an hour earlier, took place on the Isthmus of Corinth. The sea level rose suddenly in the port of Karistos in the south of the island of Euboea: the rise of the sea level reached 30 cm for 10 min. Then the water rolled away from the coast at a velocity of 3-4 knots and became 10 cm lower. This phenomenon was repeated several times over 22 hours, reaching its greatest intensity at 11h, when one boat could not leave the port in spite of all the efforts of the oarsmen in it, and a sailing vessel could not come into the port, slued round and dropped anchor on the roadstead. Strange drops in the sea level were observed on the same day on the Island of Skyros to the east of the Island of Euboea.

The main shock was followed 13 later by an aftershock of Ms&#61;7.2 located about 5 km ENE of Santorini (Perissoratis, r468).\\r\\nThis earthquake activity was associated with a very large tsunami 25 m heigh, observed in the southern coasts of Amorgos, and which affected all other central and southern Aegean islands and the northern coasts of Crete, where its heigh was 1-2 m (Perissoratis, r468). The tsunami source was located in the deepest patt of the Strait of Amorgos (Soloviev, r643).\\r\\nThe severity of the waves of July 9, 1956, was not uniform. It varied greatly from place to place and over rather short distances. Waves up to 15 m in height were observed and many casualties were reported.

Most of the fatalities were residents of the coastal villages of Pagadian. A total of 49,848 people lost their homes. Of the 11 coastal villages in Pagadian, Santa Lucia was the hardest hit because it was more populated and several communities are situated in the mangrove areas.

       "  'comments': '1977, August 19. A catastrophic earthquake shook Sumbawa Island. It covered an extensive area from the southern coast of Indonesia to the northwestern coast of Australia. A large tsunami was produced. The first press reports announced waves 30 m high in Indonesia and 8 m high in Australia Apparently, these figures were exaggerated. A group from the International Tsunami Information Center\\r\\nvisited the coastal regions of Sumba, Sumbawa, Lombok and Bali Islands to assess the destruction and wave run-ups, and to obtain other detailed information from local people. Inaccessible areas on the southern coast of Sumba and\\r\\nSumbawa islands were photographed from the air. Information was processed that had been gathered by the Indonesian military, search and rescue parties, provincial administration, and by medical teams visiting accessible areas in the coastal villages to offer help and assess the extent of loss of property and life. These records were supplemented by radio broadcast accounts from individual\\r\\nsettlements. <p>The southern coasts of the islands, with the exception of Bali, is sparsely populated. Villages are generally small and scattered. Hence the loss of human life was not high. According to incomplete data, over 180 people were killed and 3,900 were left homeless. Fishing boats and equipment were lost. For a large part of the Indonesian territory, which had sustained heavy damage from the tsunami, no information is available on the height of the rise in the water level. However, in the accessible region of Sumbawa Island, preliminary information reported that the tsunami reached a height of at least 15 m above the\\r\\nhigh-tide mark and inundated the island up to 500 m inland.\\r\\n</p><p>According to eyewitness accounts, the tsunamis appeared on the Indonesian coast about an hour or two after high tide, beginning with an ebb, which soon left a 100-200 m wide drained belt. This was followed by three large waves with a period of about 5 min or less. The first wave was the\\r\\nhighest and most ferocious. Several witnesses noted the duration of agitation of the sea although most made no mention of it. An unusual phenomenon occurred during the time interval between the earthquake and the arrival of the tsunami. Residents of villages in the Sumbawa and Lombok Islands thrice heard a sound at intervals estimated from a few seconds to 1 min and more. It was diversely described as sounding like a bomb explosion or a sonic boom. The sound\\r\\nreportedly emanated from the epicentral area. Nearly every village reported that the water became black and some reported a rise in temperature and an unpleasant smell. The tsunami reached a height of more than 10 m along the coast of Sumbawa. The main destruction was observed on the Sumbawa and Lombok islands.</p><p>The tsunami was also observed on the northern and western coasts of Australia. It was reported that on-the Australian coast, as on the Indonesian coast, three waves appeared, the first being the largest. Agitation of the sea continued for several hours. In Dampier the wave reached a height of 2 m; in Port Sampson it varied from 2 to 4 m; in Cape Leveque it reached 6 m. The arrival of the tsunami coincided with an observable ebb and a low tide in many places. These factors weakened the overall effect of the tsunami. Evidently, no lives were lost in Australia although there was one report of a person drawn into the sea by waves.</p><p>(above from reference #417)\\r\\n</p><p>A magnitude 8.0 Ms earthquake south of Sumbawa Is generated a tsunami that completely destroyed several villages. At least 100 people were killed, 89 reported missing and 75 injured. Most of the casualties and damage were caused by the tsunami. (reference #1053).\\r\\n</p><p>$1.2 million damage, 185 killed, 3900 homeless. (reference #1250)\\r\\n</p><p>On an inaccessible section of Sumbawa Is, a preliminary study indicates that the waves reached at least 15 meters above high tide, and penetrated about 500 meter inland in some valleys.

The maximum runup/wave height was reported to be 2 to 3 m, and inundation and coastal flooding extended up to 100 m inland in some locations. Both coseismic coastal uplift and the presence of fringing offshore reefs appear to have provided protection against major runup effects in some coastal areas. Elsewhere, runup effects were amplified at river mouths due to differential compaction of unconsolidated sediments. Widespread tsunami sand deposition near the Costa Rica-Panama border in 1991 is similar to deposition associated with the 7 May 1822 earthquake and tsunami. (reference #12958)</p><p>\\xa0</p>',\n",

Credible re-ports from residents in coastal towns and villages observed the sea receding 50-150 meters from the shore almost immediately after the earthquake. A 150-m recession and estimated 3-m high wave, was reported by General Magsino, a participant in the US-RP &#34;Balikatan&#34; Exercise, who ordered everyone to immediately evacuate to high ground. Two boats were damaged when the waves returned after a few minutes. In Maitum, the sea receded 300 m from the shore and the onrushing waves destroyed a pump boat; dead fish were observed soon after. In Kiamba, the sea receded 5-8 m and then rose back again, and people fled to the mountain. Subsequent tsunami modelling in collaboration with JICA expert Dr. Yuchiro Tanioka predicted 3-m high tsunami in Palimbang followed by a recession a minute after the earthquake, which were consistent with eyewitness accounts and damage reports.

Eyewitnesses interviewed by telephone the day after the earthquake reported NO tsunami in Manzanillo (report from Oceanographic Institute of the Navy), NO tsunami along the coast of Jalisco (reports from Barra de Navidad and Melaque) and NO tsunami at the Port of Lazaro Cardenas, Michoacan (report from the Captain of t he Port). Note that it was night at the time of the earthquake, which made it difficult for eyewitnesses to observe sea level fluctuations that did not overpass the higher part of the beach (the winter berm) which is on the average 1-2 meters above the high tide level along the coasts of Jalisco, Colima, and Michoacan. A field survey was conducted on January 26-28 along the coast, from La Manzanilla-Jalisco to San Juan-Michoacan, to seek tsunami traces and to determine how the people living near the coast responded to the possible tsunami. Results of the survey confirmed that no tsunami flooding occurred along the entire surveyed coast. It was also confirmed that the height of the tsunami along the coast was approximately the height of the high tide, as recorded in Manzanillo, and that it was difficult for the untrained eye to observe sea level fluctuations within the tidal range.</p>',\n",

The shock was so violent that many fortresses were thrown to the ground and the long walls at Kherronisos collapsed. In many places chasms opened into the ground and many towns perished in them. Many other misfortunes occurred, both on land as well as at sea. Springs ceased to flow and new ones burst forth. Trees were flung up roots and all and landslides changed the shape of mountains. From the sea dead fish was hurled violently on shore and many islands were inundated; and when the sea retired sailing ships were left standing on shore. The two Phrygias Bythinia and the Hellespontos suffered. This calamity persisted for a long time, though not with the same violence as it began; with time the shaking faded out until it stopped ...&gt;&gt;</p><p>This earthquake seems to have centered on the northern part of the Marmara area, and although Evagrios does not name the islands which were flooded by the sea-wave, it seems probable that they were the islets in the Sea of Marmara.</p><p>All historians concerned agree in the date of this event which can be placed in the first week of Nov 447 AD.</p><p>(above from ref #23)</p>',\n",

The few who were saved were <strong>injured</strong> and very frightened. A galleon from the Philippine islands was riding in the harbor of Acapulco at a depth of 18 m.

In Fatsa, a harbor on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, the sea receded 50 m from the shore. Then the sea dashed up the shore as far as 20 m above the normal water level [inundation]. The wave action slowly diminished until the sea returned to its normal state. A small tsunami reached the Black Sea coast of the [former] USSR and was recorded by tide gauges. These waves were recorded by almost all of the tide gauge stations on the Black Sea coast of the Crimea and the Caucasus.  The tsunami began with the rise of the sea level in all places except Batumi. Batumi was the nearest [former] USSR tide gauge to the epicenter of the earthquake. The comparison of the calculated wave travel-time data with the observed\\r\\ndata suggests that the source of the tsunami should have been either on the shore of the Black Sea near the coast of Turkey, between Batumi and Sinop, or inland. It is difficult to say anything definite about the mechanism of generation of this tsunami. It is not known whether it was\\r\\ngenerated by tectonic movement, or as that of a secondary phenomena, such as the landslide pointed out by B.

The earthquake generated tsunami waves. They were 2-3 m high in Jijel and flooded the shore several times. Lops in the sea were conserved for three days and nights. The sea near Philippeville suddenly receded and gradually returned flooding the shore up to a height of 60 cm. It receded after the earthquake in Bougie by approximately 35 m and then rose 5 m and flooded the shore 5-6 times. The sea near Bougie rose along the shore by approximately 1 m and flooded the coastal strip several times; it lasted 12 h. According to Ambraseys, the formation of this and of the previous tsunami was not related to seismo-tectonic movements of the sea bottom, but to turbulent flows, as during the September 9, 1954 events.

At Jijel, 2-3 m high waves, flooding the coast. At Philippeville (now called Skikda) the sea sudden ebbed and gradually returning flooding the coast to a height of 0.6 m (Ambraseys). At Bougie, sea level rising by 5 m flooding the coast 5-6 times. At Bone, 1 m level rise with coastal flooding.

The edifice of Yate volcano, a dissected stratocone in the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone, has experienced multiple summit collapses throughout postglacial time restricted to sectors NE and SW of the summit. The largest such historic event occurred on 19th February 1965 when ~6.1x10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> of rock and ice detached from 2,000-m elevation to the SW of the summit and transformed into a debris flow. In the upper part of the flow path, velocities are estimated to have reached 40 m s.1. After travelling 7,500 m and descending 1,490 m, the flow entered an intermontane lake, Lago Cabrera.

       "  'comments': 'October 16, 1979, 14h00m (local time). Ligurian Sea, France. Waves of the tsunami type suddenly beat down on\\r\\nFrench Riviera. The sea receded 300 m on the shore between the beach of La Salis to the south of Antibes and the vicinity of Nice, i.e. over a distance of 60 km, and then it returned with two crests 10 m high. Six people were killed and three were lost. Numerous coastal buildings were damaged, many cars were smashed, boats that had been moored were torn away and carried off to sea. Repeated oscillations of the sea level continued for over 4 hours along a 100 km stretch of coast. The waves were not preceded by an earthquake, but an embankment 300 m long, which had been erected in the delta of the River Var\\r\\non an underwater platform, disappeared into the sea in a matter of minutes practically at the same time as the waves. It was therefore assumed that the oscillations of the sea level were caused by a powerfid underwater landslide. The collapse of the embankment alone seemed to be insufficient to generate the splash of the water observed. The bathymetric survey conducted by the\\r\\nhydrographic service and by other organisations of France revealed considerable depressions in the river bottom on the eastern edge of the underwater canyon of the River Le Paillon and on the western edge of the canyon of the River Var. A landslide of the vanished material of 400 million m<sup>3</sup> in volume could easily have caused the waves observed. The underwater telephone cables, belonging to Italy, from Genoa to the Balearic Islands and from Genoa to Sassari on the Island of Sardinia were torn at 17h45m and 22h, respectively, on October 16; the sites of gaps were located 80 km and 110 km to the south of Nice, respectively. The first cable was damaged along a distance of 80 km, the second along a distance of 30 km. The\\r\\ncables from Cannes to L&#39;le Rousse (the Island of Corsica) and from Barcelona to Pisa did not suffer. (reference #2130)\\r\\n<p>A submarine slope failure occurred during the construction of the Nice new harbour. No seismic event recorded. Except one person in Antibes, the victims were working men on the building site. This gravitational submarine sliding generated a tsunami observed by several witnesses in the Baie des Anges. The maximum effects were observed 10 km from the building site near Antibes, that was inundated (one person killed). Wave heights of about 1 m observed. At La Salis (close to Antibes), witnesses reported a first wave of about 50 cm, 5 minutes after the landslide. This wave was followed by three 3 m high waves with a period of about 8 minutes. At the harbour of Saint Laurent du Var water went down (about 2 m) 1 minute after the landslide and then went up with an amplitude of 1 m.\\r\\nThe tide-gauge records of Nice and of Villefranche show that the first wave is a trough of about 10 cm. The maximum recorded wave amplitudes do not exceed 10 cm in both harbours, whereas witnesses reported wave amplitudes of about 1 m. Tsunami intensity 3. (reference #4139)</p>'},\n",

This went on till November 15, on which date, after vespers, there commenced a succession of rumblings, so loud as to deafen one, and the volcano began to vomit forth smoke so dense and black as to darken the atmosphere, and at the same time such a great quantity of large stones fell into the lake as to cause big waves. The earth trembled, the houses shook, and yet this was but the preparation for a fresh rain of scoriae and ashes, which lasted the whole of the afternoon and part of the night.\\r\\n</p><p>(above from reference #2070)\\r\\n</p><p>Twelve persons are known to have perished - some carried away by the waves of the lake, others crushed beneath their collapsing homes.

A great number of detonations were heard in the air, and shortly after it became plain that the volcano in Lake Bombon had burst on its southeastern side, which faces Lipa, so that the whole point called Calauit appeared to be on fire. Later on the eruption seemed to spread into the lake, in the direction of Mount Macolod, which rises opposite the volcano on the southeastern shore of the lake. Great masses of smoke, water, and ashes rushed out of the lake, high up into the air, looking like towers.  Simultaneously there was a great commotion in the earth which stirred up the water in the lake, forming immense waves which lashed the shores as though a violent typhoon were raging. Their fury was such that in front of the Convento of Taal, and in other places of the beach, a strip of more than 10 brazas [16.7 meters] in width was engulfed by the water, and the church was endangered. On the following days, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, things continued in the same way, but by Sunday all the combustible material appears to have been consumed. This eruption killed all the fishes, large and small, the waves casting them ashore in a state as if they had been cooked, since the water had been heated to a degree that it appeared to have been taken from a boiling caldron. There was an all-pervading, pestilential stench of sulphur which greatly molested the inhabitants of the towns surrounding the lake. Sunday morning the sun broke through, but later torrential rains fell with thunder and lightning, some of the latter striking and the whole causing the greatest terror. Finally, however, the weather cleared, and of the whole tragedy there remained no other signs than the stench of sulphur and of the great quantity of dead fish cast upon the beach by the waves.

Many houses, churches and towers collapsed with <b>little or no loss of life</b>, due to the fact that the people, warned by the foreshock, had taken refuge in the open.

The shock was strongly felt in Zante and throughout the Peloponnese.\\r\\n</p><p>Following the earthquake the sea in the Gulf of Corinth near Vostiza receded a great distance from the shore and, on returning with great violence, flooded the town three times. The third wave was so large that it reached the upper part of the town, beyond the Platanos, flooding the hill slopes to the south that overlook the town, washing away houses, stores and the customs house, and stripping trees of their leaves. Destruction was instantaneous and all sailing ships, boats and two large coasting vessels in the port at the time of the earthquake were totally destroyed.

There was a destructive earthquake (37N 73W, mag 8.25) and tsunami in the center part of Chile with its source near Concepcion. </p><p>When the earthquake began, the whole surface of water in Concepcion (Talcahuano) Bay churned. The water darkened and gave off the very unpleasant odor of hydrogen sulphide. At approximately one half hour after the earthquake, the water in the bay receded to the point where all rocks and reefs were laid bare. Then it flooded once more and again receded so that vessels anchored in the bay appeared to be on dry land. Then a huge wave, from the island of Quiriquina, passed along the west shore of the bay, shearing off houses, uprooting trees, sweeping and carrying away everything that was movable... After several minutes a second huge wave appeared, approaching with an even more terrifying noise and violence than the first. Despite the enormity of the wave, its passage was less destructive since there was little left to destroy... After several minutes of tense expectancy, the inhabitants, who had taken refuge on higher ground, saw a third wave rolling between the island of Quiriquina and the mainland.. This wave appeared even larger than the two previous ones (by other accounts, it was somewhat smaller); it roared, dashing against obstacles and carrying along everything in its path. Then suddenly, as if repulsed by the foothills, the water receded, carrying away such a huge quantity of articles snatched from houses (partitions, furniture, etc.), that after the ebb, the whole ocean appeared to be covered with this wreckage. This disaster prompted the inhabitants to begin noticing approaching waves when they were still 5-7 km away from shore. </p><p>\\r\\nWaves were reported along the coast from Valparaiso to the island of Chiloe, a distance of more than 1000 km.\\r\\n</p><p>In Talcahuano Bay, one woman took to a boat with her son, but...the boat split and the <b>woman drowned</b>.  Near Niebla Port, Valdivia, a <b>man and a woman drowned</b>, apparently while collecting shellfish. </p><p>A segment of the Chilean coast in the earthquake focal zone was elevated. The bay at Talcahuano became shallower while the shore of the bay was lifted approximately 1 m. The coast at San Vicente rose 0.5 m. Santa Maria Island rose 2.5-3 m in the middle, 3 m in the north, 2.5 m in the south. Mocha Island rose 0.5 m. Then the elevated block slowly subsided and after 2 months the rise of the shores at Talchuano was reduced to 0.5 m. This subsidence apparently came to a stop simultaneously with the cessation of the aftershocks.\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #3903:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>&#34;[Charles] Darwin described the tidal wave at Valdivia in 1835, again following a severe earthquake, as producing a quiet rapid rise and rapid fall...[At Concepcion] Thirty minutes after the earthquake the sea retired so far as to strand ships in 7 fathoms of water. All the reefs came into view. Then the return wave poured in thirty feet above high tide. Two others followed, some minutes apart, and progressively bigger. Then for several days there were small oscillations.&#34;\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #5324:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>1835, February 20th, 15:30 UTC. Central Chile: -36.5, -72.60.

The small amount of damage was attributed to the prevalence of timber construction. Montessus de Ballore claims that no &#34;maremoto&#34; was generated; yet the reports of tsunami damage on Samoa, Hawaii, and the coast of Japan must be connected with this event. Three successive fluctuations of the sea were observed in Ancud, but no wave was generated along the east coast of the island. On some flat shores the flooding extended up to 1000 yards inland, but no damage was reported.

       "  'comments': '<p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #414:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>1896, June 15, 19:33 (local time). A strong earthquake in Sanriku, Honshu Island, was felt over an enormous area and generated a catastrophic tsunami. According to official accounts, 10,617 buildings were washed away, 27,122 people died, and 9,247 people were injured... The tsunami was observed at least from the south of Hokkaido Island to the Bonin Islands, and also on the Hawaiian Islands and in North America. The Sanriku coast on a stretch of more than 400 km from Kinkazan Island in the south to Cape Shiriya in the north, suffered most of all.\\r\\n</p><p>At most places on the Sanriku coast, the tsunami began with a noticeable ebb tide. The exact time of the beginning of the ebb tide in the pleistoseismic area is unknown. According to the data of the hydrometeorological station at Miyako and the accounts of some eyewitnesses, the ebb tide began at nightfall, 15-30 minutes after the earthquake. The first tidal wave arrived immediately after 20:00. Consequently, the time difference between the beginning of the ebb tide and the arrival of the tidal wave was 30 minutes. The magnitude of the ebb tide naturally depended on the depth of the sea: in shallows, the water retreated a great distance, while at deep places, it retreated a small distance. Thus the water retreated 350 m at Horiuchi, 350-550 m at Ryoisi and Ooya, 500 m at Minatohama and 35 m at Tadaide.</p><p>Before the flood tide, a loud rumble like thunder or the noise of a squall could be heard from far at sea. The wave appeared simultaneously with the rumble on the coast of Kesen district, Iwate Prefecture, while it appeared soon after the rumble at other places. It is said that it was even heard in the prefectures of Akita and Yamagata.</p><p>It is also very difficult to establish the time of arrival of the tidal wave. The time, estimated by the hydrometeorological station at Miyako, 20:07 can be considered the most precise. According to the report of this station, the tsunami began 18 minutes after the first underground shock. A flood tide began at about 20:00, and a wave of great height, accompanied by a loud rumble, arrived at 20:07. Then the flood tides recurred six times: at 20:15, 20:32, 20:48, 20:59, 21:16 and 21:50. The second, the largest wave, washed away many people and carried\\r\\nhomes out to sea.</p><p>The average period of oscillations on the Sanriku coast after the arrival of the tsunami was about 15 minutes. The intensity of the waves began to gradually abate after 22:00, but small oscillations in sea level were still being observed at noon of the following day. The greatest height of rise of water was registered at Yoshihama and Ryori. The second, greatest wave was 24 m high at Yoshihama and the water rose 30 m at Ryori.</p><p>On June 15, the residents of the prefectures on the Sanriku coast were celebrating a national holiday in the streets; there was no work that day. After the ebb tide, with which the tsunami began, some hurried away from the water, but the majority continued the festivities. Practically the entire population of the flooded zone, except for a few individuals miraculously spared, perished in the roller which fell on the Sanriku coast. In addition, the fishermen who had gone out to sea were saved; returning home in the morning, knowing nothing about the events, they saw a horrible picture: the sea was strewn with debris of homes and corpses for several km from shore and heaps of ruins or bare expanses remained in place of the previous coastal villages and cities.\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #150:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>1896, June 15, (19:33 local time). 39.5 N, 144 E, magnitude 7.6, Sanriku. 26,360 deaths (22,000 deaths by Yamashita), more than 11,000 homes wrecked and washed away.

Messina and Reggio Calabria completely destroyed, and also other villages: Faro, Ganzirri, S.Agata, Pace, Camaro, Gazzi, Cannitello, Villa S.Giovanni, S.Gregorio, etc. Partial destruction in most of Calabria and Sicily. In Messina all buildings ruined and after the shock a violent fire broke out. In Reggio Calabria all buildings ruined. The area of destruction was about 6,000 square km wide. More than 60,000 people died. Some strong foreshocks occurred on December 5, 6, 23, 25 and many aftershocks occurred till February 1909.</p><p>Violent tsunami in the Messina Straits that caused severe damage and hundreds of victims. In most places the first movement was a sea withdrawal (in some places about 200 m) for a few minutes. Then the sea flooded the coast with at least three big waves. The sea level oscillations lasted many hours, gradually diminishing. The tsunami reached its maximum intensity in the Calabrian coast near Pellaro, Lazzaro and Gallico and, in the Sicily coast, in Giardini and S.Alessio. It was very strong in the eastern Sicily coast and it was observed in the Tyrrhenian Calabria as far as Porto S.Venere and in Sicily as far as Trabia and Termini Imerese. In some localities the biggest wave was the first, while in others it was the second. The observed maximum wave height generally was an inverse function of the distance from the epicenter, but in the Strait this was masked by local amplification effects. A post-event survey allowed for damage estimates, flooding and run-up: it was ascertained that the tsunami caused many victims (the exact number is unknown, due to the catastrophic effects of the earthquake) and severe damage to buildings, ships, boats and nature. The tsunami involved mainly the eastern Sicily coast but also the southern and the northern ones.</p><p>At Messina the first sea movement was an ingression. The wave inundated many places causing severe damage to harbor infrastructures, boats and houses. All piers in the harbor lowered and some of them collapsed. Most damage in the southern beach of the city, close to the Portalegna stream. The english cemetery was completely destroyed. Many boats were carried onshore and destroyed. Many vessels moored in the harbor felt a sudden considerable sea level rise just a few minutes after the shock, and some of them broke their mooring. According to the Harbor Office report, the tsunami occurred 8 min after the shock. At least three huge waves were observed, the first was the biggest. Water height reached about 3 m.</p><p><i>Reference #516</i>:<br />On both sides of the Strait, many buildings were swept away by the waves. In Sicily, 79 people were drowned, and, on the Calabrian coast, more than 141.</p><p><i>Reference #5096</i>:<br />Guidoboni et al (2007) contend that <strong>80,000 people were killed by the earthquake, including as many as 2,000 who died as a result of the tsunami</strong>. Waves up to 12 m struck the shorelines south of Messina and south of Reggio Calabria, displacing the rubble from collapsed buildings and completing the destruction. All communications in the affected area were disrupted, and rescue operations had to rely on access from the sea.</p><p><i>Reference #10248</i>:<br />The 28 Dec 1908 Messina earthquake was one of the most destructive events in Italy and was associated with one of the largest tsunami inundations in recent history. About 60 000 people died because of the earthquake and about 1500 were killed by the tsunami. The cities of Messina and Reggio-Calabria were damaged extensively. The tsunami run-up was 3m in the Messina harbour and as high as 13m in the village of Pellaro, and the tsunami waves entered 200m inland in several locations along the coast of the Messina Straits.</p>',\n",

The largest of these was the landslide at Cape White Cliffs to the south of Caramia.

There was a strong earthquake and catastrophic tsunami with source off the Sanriku Coast. The maximal rise of water was 28 m on this coast, 9 m on the south of Hokkaido Island, and 3 m in the Hawaiian Islands. More than 3,000 residents died in Japan.\\r\\nMore than 6,000 structures and 12,000 ships and boats were washed away and destroyed.  \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote>Reference #150:</blockquote> \\r\\n<p>March 3, 1933, 02:31 [local time], 39.1 N, 144.7 E, depth 10 km, magnitude 8.3 MS. 1,522 deaths, 1,542 unknown, 4,034 houses washed away, 1,817 houses destroyed. \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote>Reference #1006:</blockquote> \\r\\n<p>March 2, 1933 (March 3, Japanese time). This wave followed a very great earthquake off the eastern, or Sanriku, coast of the main Japanese island of Honshu.\\r\\nThe earthquake damage was moderate, but the tsunami was devastating. In places the waves rose as high as 75 feet. \\r\\nMiyabe investigated the times of arrival of the waves as recorded on mareograms. At such distant points as San Francisco, Honolulu, Iquique, times of arrival check well enough for a wave starting from the earthquake epicenter at\\r\\nabout the time calculated as origin time from seismograms (which is good to within a very few seconds). However, the times recorded at Japanese tide stations are in part anomalous; at some of the more distant stations the tsunami was actually recorded as beginning 20 minutes earlier than at the nearest ones. This discrepancy may be due in part to seiches started by the seismic waves in the ground; Miyabe prefers to conclude that the tsunami probably did not originate from a point. In so great an earthquake, which almost certainly involved extensive faulting or block movement, this is to be expected. Omote proposes that there was an earlier wave originating around the margin of an area several hundred kilometers wide and a later wave from a more limited source of the order of 10 kilometers in diameter. An interesting detail was the recording at tide stations in Australia and New Zealand of waves, reflected from the American coast, traveling twice across the Pacific in about 47 hours. \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote>Reference #3909:</blockquote> \\r\\n<p>In Japan there was a great disaster in Iwate province\\r\\nfrom both earthquake and tidal wave, with reported loss\\r\\nof 1535 lives, 2000 wounded, 7930 houses, 1570 boats, and\\r\\nmillions of dollars of property damage at the ports of\\r\\nKamaishi, Miyako, Yamoto and Omoto. \\r\\n</p><table><tbody><tr><td><br /><b><h2>Different Reports of Effects</h2></b>\\r\\n<table><tbody><tr><td>\\r\\n<table><tbody><tr><td valign=\"bottom\"><b>Deaths</b></td><td valign=\"bottom\"><b>Missing</b></td><td align=\"center\"><b>Houses<br />Washed Away</b></td><td align=\"center\"><b>Houses<br />Destroyed</b></td><td valign=\"bottom\"><b>Reference #</b></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Severe damage</td><td></td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td align=\"middle\">1,522</td><td>1,542</td><td>4,034</td><td>1,817</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td align=\"middle\">3,000</td><td></td><td>6,000</td><td></td><td>414</td></tr><tr><td align=\"middle\">2,986</td><td></td><td>4,086</td><td></td><td>1068</td></tr></tbody></table>\\r\\n</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>',\n",

Property damage from these waves in the Hawaiian Islands was estimated at $800,000 to $1,000,000; however no lives were lost. It also caused damage on the west coast of the United States and was observed on tide gauges throughout the Pacific Basin.\\r\\n<p>Reference #79 lists considerable damage and considerable loss of life in the Kuril Islands.\\r\\n</p><p>The waves of the tsunami of 4-5 November 1952 were noted from Iturup l. on the south (height of wave 2.5 m.) to the village of Shubertovo near Ust&#39;-Kamchatsk (wave height 0.5-1 m.) and had destructive force over an extent of more than 700 km. of the Pacific coast -- from Onekotan l. on the south to the Kronotsky Peninsula (Kamchatka) on the north. The morphology of the shores and the relief of the bottoms of bays and straits played an important role in the heightening of the waves upon their arrival at the coast; waves which were imperceptible to ships on the open ocean, at the coast transformed themselves into terrible battering rams, which not only destroyed installations but changed the coastal relief, washing away sandy soils and causing landslides... The greatest destruction and suffering of 4-5 November were caused by the tsunami which arose as a result of the earthquake and which took in about 700 km of the east coasts of Kamchatka and the Kuril Is. On the average the height of the waves on the coast reached 6-7 m. In Kamchatka and on the Kuril Is. destructive sea waves appeared 30-40 minutes after the earthquake. At most points the beginning phase of the waves was accompanied by a lowering of the level of the ocean. Hence it follows that\\r\\nthe actual moment of appearance of the waves on the coast occurred half a period earlier. (reference #4252)\\r\\n</p><p>Kurilske was about 15 thousand inhabitants, about 4 thousand perished, extensive destruction... (reference #9224)\\r\\n</p><p> Because of the absence of casualties in the far field, this event was often perceived as involving a deceptive\\r\\ntsunami, as no reports were available from the near field. The 1952 Kamchatka tsunami was, in fact, a closely\\r\\nguarded state secret in the then-USSR, especially since we now know that it had eradicated the sensitive naval\\r\\nbase at Severo-Kuril&#39;sk. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, information started to slowly trickle out\\r\\nin the form either of dissemination abroad of existing reports or of studies resulting from new research into this matter. Among the latter, Smyshlyaev (reference #11472) reported 7,802 civilian deaths in the Northern Kurils, and estimated that the total death toll in the city of Severo-Kuril&#39;sk, including military casualties, must have reached 10,000 and perhaps as high as 17,000, making the event by far the deadliest tsunami in the twentieth century. (reference #9223)\\r\\n</p><p>). Present day estimates based on the existed  data on population density in the area and available damage reports from some selected coastal locations show that  minimum number of victims was about 4000 people with estimated maximum as high as 14000 fatalities (Smyshlyaev, 2003). Based on this, the most realistic estimate for the fatality level can be adopted as 10,000 people, the majority of which (more than 99%) were killed by tsunami. (reference #11763)\\r\\n</p><p>The source of 1952 earthquake was located in two time zones. According to Greenwich (UTC), the earthquake happened on November 4 at 16 hours 58 minutes. In Kamchatka (&#43;12 hours) at this time was November 5, 4-58 am, and in Kuril Islands, which live in Sakhalin time (&#43;11 hours) was 3-58 am. So, local people from Severo-Kurilsk use the time 4 am for the earthquake (reference #12048)\\r\\n</p><p>View a calculated <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu_travel_time.shtml#Kam1952\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tsunami-travel-time map</a>.</p>',\n",

       "  'comments': 'On June 2, 1994, a magnitude 7.2 Ms (Mw 7.8) (HRV) earthquake at 18:18 UT occurred south of Java, Indonesia. The earthquake was about 200 km off the southeastern coast of Java. The earthquake occurred at night, and awoke only about 10 to 20% of the people. About 30 to 40 minutes after the earthquake, the waves (three distinct waves) began to arrive. Most of the people were still sleeping when the wave arrived, and the mostly-straw houses were washed away.\\r\\nAbout <b>223 people were killed, 15 were listed as missing, and 423 injured</b>. The tsunami <b>destroyed 1,500 homes, and 278 boats</b>. The most affected districts were Lumajang, Jember, and Banyuwangi. Most of the fatalities and damage was caused by a tsunami at the villages of Pancer, Lampon, and Rajekwesi in the Banyuwangi district, the most eastern of the districts.\\r\\n<p>At Pancer, an important village situated on sand dunes of a river mouth into the bay, more than 70% of the 1,000 buildings were destroyed but only 4% (122 people) of the 3,000 inhabitants were killed, and 15 were missing. All of the straw houses were destroyed, and most of the brick buildings were severely damaged. The second wave was the largest and penetrated 300 meters inland. Palm trees\\r\\nbetween the village and the sea helped to mitigate the wave damage although most were uprooted. The maximum runup height was 9.5 meters. The wave advanced up the river causing lateral flooding. One boat was carried 60 meters inland.\\r\\n</p><p>Lampon, the most eastern of the villages surveyed, had a population of 700 inhabitants before the tsunami. There were 35 fatalities and 40 straw houses destroyed some of which were 500 meters inland. The wave destroyed houses 500 meters inland. Most of the damage occurred near the river where there was significant erosion. The wave penetrated one km along the river. A maximum wave height of eleven meters was measured over a steep bank.\\r\\n</p><p>At Rajekwesi there were 1,200 inhabitants and 300 homes. Seventy percent of the homes were built with straw. There were 33 fatalities, 14 missing, and 70 homes destroyed. Eyewitnesses reported the first wave was about one meter high, and the second wave was six to seven meters high and had an inundation of 100 meters. There was large erosion of the beach and riverbank. Palm trees near the shore were uprooted. The straw houses were leveled, and all brick buildings were damaged. \\r\\n</p><p>At Watuula Village of about 600 inhabitants, 16 straw houses were destroyed, three fishermen were killed, and 30 boats were severely damaged. The wave reached a height of 7.58 meters.\\r\\n</p><p>At Pulo Merah there were eight fatalities and 20 houses were destroyed. Many others were severely damaged. The water penetrated about 700 meters inland, carrying fish, shellfish, and stones. At the village of Puger there was no tsunami damage although the third wave penetrated 300 meters inland, about the same extent as that of large storm waves. Six fishermen who were working on the open sea were missing.\\r\\n</p><p>At the village of Cape Pelindu, a small fishing village of about 300 inhabitants, the maximum wave was 3.2 meters. It destroyed three homes and the wall protecting the fishery.

A local tsunami occurred with a maximum runup of 7.3 meters on the southwest coast of Baco Island at Sitio Pino and 6.1 meters on the northern coast. Eyewitnesses reported the water first receded 45 meters. There were no deaths on Baco Island and only one home\\r\\ndestroyed.

It generated a tsunami that arrived at Eratini immediately after the earthquake. It had a runup height of 0.4-0.5 meters after a withdrawal of one meter a few minutes after the earthquake for a wave height (range) of 1.5 meters. (reference #1315)\\r\\n</p><p>On 15 June 1995, 00:16 GMT, a strong (Ms&#61;6.0) earthquake ruptured the western side of the Corinthos Gulf. The earthquake caused extensive damage in several towns and villages along both coastlines of the Gulf, the northern and the southern ones. The maximum intensity (VII&#43;) was felt in the city of Aegion, southern coastline, where the collapse of two multi-storied buildings caused a death toll of 26. Extensive coastal ground breaks and subsequent ground submergence were reported in both coastlines. In the northern coastline, a local tsunami wave was officially reported from the town of Eratini (peak-to-trough 1.5 m) being located in the epicentral area. The wave was observed immediately after the earthquake occurrence. Its maximum vertical run-up was of about 004-0.5 m, while a water withdrawal of about 1 m occurred a few minutes after the earthquake. The water disturbance lasted for about 12 hours. Damage was not reported. Judging from that no tsunami was reported from other coastal places of the epicentral or more remote areas it is tentatively concluded that the wave could be attributed to the reported massive sliding in the sea of unconsolidated sediments accumulated at the local river mouth. A similar mechanism of tsunamigenesis at the same place was considered in association with the earthquake (Ms&#61;6.3) of 6 July 1965. Tsunami generation from either seismic or aseismic sliding of coastal or submarine sediment masses is rather frequent in the Greek Archipelago, including the Gulf of Corinthos.

       "  'comments': 'On November 16, 17 and 18, a series of very large earthquakes occurred in the area around New Ireland and New Britain of Papua New Guinea. Given the large size of the two earthquakes occurring on November 16, it has been difficult to determine which seismic event caused what runup, as flooding and tsunami waves have been reported as inundating several coastlines. These include, unconfirmed reports of runup on the islands of Bougainville (Torokina reporting 2.5 to 3 m. runup) and Buka. In addition, it was reported a tsunami reaching Trobriand Islands (SW Solomon Sea) measured .3-1 meter. According to Rabaul Volcano Observatory (e-mail correspondence, Dec. 1, 2000) initial indications were that only the first large earthquake (4:55 UTC) caused a tsunami. But after reference to tide gauge records, it appeared most likely that it was the second earthquake (7:42 UTC) that created a tsunami. The inundation of a hardware store in Rabaul, occurring 20-30 minutes following the first earthquake, was most likely caused by a seiche. Runup of .9 meter was reported in\\r\\nRabaul. Because it was dark by the time the aftershock occurred it was difficult to verify when some coastlines were inundated. Follow-up confirmation reports and tide gage records have yet to be received.

Tsunami damage was also observed along the southwestern coast of New Ireland, the west coast of Bougainville and on Buka.

Run up heights on open coast were generally less than 1 m, but reached 1.5 m at Kauk and an estimated \\r\\n3-4 m in west-facing bays on the islands, and on the mainland coast immediately east of Boiken.\\r\\nThe higher run-up in the west-facing bays was a funneling effect. In both Victoria Bay and Mushu Bay, the larger of the west-facing bays on Mushu Island, observers saw the water circulate counter clockwise around the perimeter of the bay, and reach maximum height in the eastern extremity of each bay. Logs were washed ashore amongst the houses at Buruwan on Victoria Bay and 50 m of land was inundated. Logs, coral and a moored dinghy were washed ashore in Mushu Bay. The reason for the higher run-up east of Boiken is less clear, but perhaps was due to the funneling of the tsunami between the coast and the islands. Tsunami effects were observed as far east as Murik Lakes; where water washed through the villages at ankle depth. The villages are on a low sand bar. In the west, a repeated rising and falling of the water level in the Aitape River of the order of 1 m above normal water level was observed at 6.45 to 7 am. In Wewak too, there was a fluctuation of the sea level at 6:45-7 am, the water draining out into the bay then returning passively to flood across the road, before subsiding to normal level. The drop in sea level was estimated to be 2 m, and the rise above normal sea level, 1.5-2 m. The fluctuations at 6:45 am appear to have been a second and discrete tsunami event.\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11914:</i></blockquote>\\r\\n<p>It is notable that the amplitude and effects of the tsunami  were greatest in the Boiken - Muschu Is. - Kairiru Is. area, about 70-80 km from the epicenter of the main earthquake and about 20-30km from the location of the CMT. In the area of maximum damage from earthquake shaking, between Boiken and the mouth of Hawain River, the tsunami was reported to have had turbulent, violent flow. At Victoria Bay at the eastern end of Kairiru Island, the tsunami was observed to approach from the southwest and swirled along the cost with an anti-clockwise motion depositing large logs and other debris. At these locations and on both northern and southern coasts of Muschu Island houses were swept away by the tsunami.

(reference #3025)\\r\\n</p><p>The destructive Zemmouri earthquake of 2003 May 21 (Mw 6.8) occurred at 18:44 (GMT) along the coast, 50 km east of the city of Algiers, between the cities of Zemmouri and Boumerdès. This shock, the largest felt in this region since the 1716 event, had the epicenter  located very close to the coast (about 4 km) and the earthquake produced severe damage and more than 2,000 victims. Two main phenomena were associated to the earthquake: shoreline uplift along 50 km and a tsunami, triggered either by the earthquake itself or by a submarine landslide. According to Dr. Yelles, director of the CRAAG center in Algiers, the tsunami waves were generated by a river sediment slide. In fact, the area is well known for a large sediment deposited by a river, a deposit which is highly unstable. Instantaneously with the Zemmouri earthquake, a tsunami was generated along the northern Algerian coasts. No run-up values were reported along the Algerian coasts, indicating that the tsunami waves, if any, were not high enough to inundate beyond original shoreline. \\r\\n(reference #4139)\\r\\n</p><p>A strong tsunami with sea disturbances observed along the Algerian coast, but with significant damage mainly in the Balearic Islands (Spain) harbours, affected the western Mediterranean following the 2003 Zemmouri earthquake (MW 6.9, Algeria). An average regional uplift of 0.55 m was measured along the shoreline in the epicentral area. Field observations, main shock and aftershocks characteristics are consistent with thrust along a ∼55-km-long rupture, trending NE-SW, dipping SE. The seismotectonic parameters indicate a hypocentre 7-8 km deep and a possible fault break between 5 and 15 km offshore. Several tide gauges located in the western Mediterranean Coast indicated an average of 0.4 m of sea-level change with a maximum of 2 m in the Balearic Islands. (reference #12057)</p>',\n",

There was a very strong earthquake, which affected all Ambon Island and adjacent islands and left human victims...</p><p>Immediately after the earthquake, a tsunami occurred on the entire coast of Ambon Island. The northwestern shore of Hitu peninsula suffered most of all, especially the region of Ceyt, between Lima (Negrilima) and Hila. Here the water rose 80-100 m that is, to the top of the coastal hills. The trees, including those in the clove plantations, which covered the calcareous coastal slopes at Mamala, Ela, Sinalo, Kaitetto, Ceyt, Loboleu, almost as far as Lima, were uprooted. Only the higher-lying plantations at Nausihola, Wakal and Hitulama escaped destruction.</p><p>Everything was so &#34;jumbled&#34; onshore that it was unrecognizable. In the region of Loboleu, a coastal strip with the width of a musket shot subsided. The shore became very precipitous between Cety and Hila and at Hila itself, part of the coast also collapsed into the water, carrying with it the settlements of Nukali, Ehalaa, and Wawani. In all, 2243 people died on Ambon island as a result of the tsunami.</p><p>According to eyewitness accounts, the water rose up like a mountain. First it inundated Loboleu, and then it split into three streams. One of them spread along the coast to the west to Lima and Urien, another to the east to Hila, and the third went out to sea, in the direction to Cape Ryst on Ceram Island, carrying with it trees, houses, domestic livestock and people. The movements of the water were accompanied by a very loud nose. The moving water was black, very dirty and evil smelling; its surface phosphoresced.</p><p>According to the eyewitnesses, the surface of the sea in the strait between Ceram and Ambon Islands, was calm, and it was agitated and made a deafening noise only off shore, to the distance of a musket shot. People in a boat not far from shore did not notice anything unusual in the state of the sea; the oscillations in its surface were just as weak and small as usual. On the coast, all the proas and other boats were smashed or carried away by the water. Many fish were tossed up on land.</p><p><i>Ref #40 and #132:</i><br />1674, Feb. 17.

(2012) and Harris and Major (2017) speculated that it was <strong>triggered by an earthquake from south of Ambon and a landslide triggered by an earthquake from inside Ambon Bay, respectively</strong>. However, no attempt has been made to investigate this event further, particularly to answer why the extreme run-up was observed only on the northern coast of Ambon. Therefore, the primary source of the tsunami and earthquake remains open to question [...] More significantly, we have shown that the only way to explain the extreme run-up only on the northern shore of Ambon, and in particular the very narrow lateral extent along the coast over which it occurred, is by attributing the tsunami generation to a submarine landslide.</p>',\n",

The radiotelegraph station on the eastern part of New Guinea broadcast that, according to a report from the &#34;Duris&#34; steamship, on December 24, 1930, the Western Islets were hit by a destructive earthquake. The waves flooded the land to a height of 2.5 m (8 feet). Homes and cattle were washed away on Awin Island. The newspapers also reported that one European and many local residents escaped by scrambling up the palm trees. No reports of a tsunami were received from Indonesia.

Indications show that the water attained a height of 20 to 25 feet at Sapara and swept inland to a depth of approximately two to three hundred yards, washing masses of coral reef ashore and wrecking everything in its path except for full grown coconuts and large isolated trees.\\r\\n</p><p>To the north of Sapara the village of Simbini suffered the most damage - 24 houses being destroyed. At Awar Plantation the wave attained a height of about 12 feet.\\r\\n</p><p>From the Administration Report to Prime Minister&#39;s Department, Canberra, 2 January 1931, for effects on Ninigo Group, New Guinea from the event on Dec. 24, 1930:\\r\\n</p><p>At the time of the occurrence, some of the natives of the island of Lau were engaged in cutting copra [on Mal Island]. <b>One child and one man were drowned</b>. The natives employed by a trochus fisher were caught in the wave, but all escaped though some of them were bruised and bumped by the floating debris.\\r\\nSome of these men tried to save themselves as they were being washed across the end of the island by catching at the fronds of the coconut palms. As the palms are about 30 to 40 feet in height this will give some idea of the size of the wave. If the waves had occurred at high tide the loss of life and damage to property would have been much greater...\\r\\n</p><p>Practically all the native canoes at the affected places were either broken or damaged and there was a fairly heavy toll of pigs, fowls and dogs. </p><p>Except for minor instances native gardens were not affected or damaged but all Kapiaks, Betelnut, banana paw-paw and other natural products growing on areas affected by the wave have died from the effects of the salt water...\\r\\n</p><p>Natives report that a similar occurrence happened 40 to 50 years ago and there is no doubt that the knowledge of the previous event minimized casualties, in that when the sea began to recede the majority of the natives ran into the bush...</p><p>To sum up the position as far as the District of Manus is concerned, is that it has had a very fortunate escape.

(ref #1053)\\r\\n</p><p>This was a \\x91slow earthquake&#39;, meaning that the rupture occurred more slowly and took longer than in a normal earthquake. Slow earthquakes usually occur at very shallow depths and produce greater displacements than normal earthquakes. As a consequence, they are more likely to significantly displace the seabed and generate tsunamis. In addition, the magnitude of slow earthquakes may be underestimated by traditional magnitude calculations because the energy they radiate is deficient in high frequencies due to the slower rupture speed. Further, the strongest energy release of the earthquake may occur minutes after the initial rupture and thus not be captured by the initial magnitude calculation. This event was also called a \\x91tsunami earthquake,&#39; which is an earthquake that generates a tsunami much larger than expected given the earthquake magnitude. \\x91Tsunami earthquakes&#39; are often caused by \\x91slow earthquakes&#39;. According to a ReliefWeb report, on 19 July, Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla announced that the death toll had reached 525 with 273 people missing. Most damage centred on the town of Pangandaran. More than 50,000 people were evacuated. (ref #9200)\\r\\n</p><p>802 killed, 35,543 affected, $55 million damage. (ref #1250)\\r\\n</p><p>A large tsunami occurred over more than 250 km of the south Java coast from Garut prefecture in the west to Yogyakarta prefecture in the east. In the heavily damaged area of Pangandaran, the estimated run-up heights from eyewitness accounts is 4 to 6 m. Along the southwest shore of Pangandaran National Park, which is a small spit that extends about a kilometer to the south, the tsunami was relatively small. From observations of markers consisting of lines of sands and leaves, the tsunami did not appear very high-about 1 to 2 m. Measurements of runup heights (Indonesia Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries et al. 2006 and Kongko et al. 2006) show variable inundations ranging from 1 to 8 m across the region[...]Eyewitness accounts consistently mentioned two large waves with the second wave larger and about 10 to 20 minutes after the first[...]The largest loss of life was in the resort area of Pangandaran, where more than 200 people were killed.

       "  'comments': '1033, Dec 05. Tsunami in Acre, and possibly nearby coast.\\r\\nThis earthquake and tsunami have been widely referred to in the published literature. Ambraseys (ref#15) and Ambraseys (ref#3845) relate this tsunami to the coasts of Lebanon and Israel. Amiran (ref#10419) suggest that the tsunami occurred on Jan 4, 1034, in Jaffa, and that the port of Akko fell dry for an hour. Soloviev (ref#2130) mention that tidal waves were observed in Gaza and Ashkelon, and that the seaport of Akko became dry for a long time and then it was half destroyed by a wave. Guidoboni (ref#10420) interpret that the tsunami effect is confined to Acre, but it is reasonable to suppose that the tsunami affected more of the coast. Ambraseys (ref#9116) constrains the tsunami to Acre and suggests that it did not cause damage or loss of life inland. Shalem (ref#10422), however, suspects this description might have been duplicated from the 1068 event. Following the detailed analysis of Ambraseys (ref#3845) and Guidoboni (ref#10420), the tsunami can be constrained to the northern and central coasts of Israel only.<p>Regarding the cause of the tsunami, Amiran (ref#10419) mention a swarm of earthquakes during the winter of 1033/4, probably in the Jordan Valley, including the strongest shock on 1033 12 10 and another one on 1034 01 04. Ambraseys (ref#10421) and Ambraseys (ref#3845) also locate the earthquake in the Jordan Valley but date it on 1033 12 05. A detailed analysis by Guidoboni (ref#10420) suggests that the earthquake occurred on 1033 12 05, although Arabic sources give the date of 1033 12 05 as 1034 01 04. In their opinion, Perrey (ref#10418) dated this event to 1032 03 06, which is then further confused with 1033 03 06, the date of the earthquake that occurred in Constantinople. </p><p>(above from ref #10416)</p><p>1033, Dec 5. A damaging earthquake occurred in Palestine... In Acre the sea flowed out several kilometres before flowing back as a wave an hour later.

In Ghaza the mosque and its minarets at El Gaalan were destroyed also upper part of lighthouse badly damaged. In Nablus 1/2 of the city fell down, many villages in El Badou were swallowed up in the ground. In Egypt the earthquake caused much damage. There were 70,000 victims. (ref #1222)</p><p>1034, Jan. 4. Tsunami on the coasts of Lebanon and Israel, Acre. (ref #15 and #20)</p><p>1034, Jan 4; or Mar 6, 1032; 1039; or May 1035. A strong destructive earthquake occurred in the vast region from Syria in the northeast to Egypt in the southwest. Half of the city of Nablus and 1/3 of the city of Ramallah were destroyed. In Jerusalem, walls were destroyed, the temple was badly damaged, other buildings suffered damage. In Gaza the mosque and the lighthouse were damaged, heavy damage was caused in Ashkelon. After one or several earthquakes the sea retreated from the shore and returned swiftly. Tidal waves were observed in Gaza and in Ashkelon. The seaport of Akko became dry for a long time, then it was half destroyed by a wave. (ref #2130)</p><p>1035, April or May. From the study of the available information on these individual earthquakes, it appears that there are at least four major distinct earthquakes that occurred between 1033 and 1035 AD. A third very strong earthquake occurred in April or early May 1035 AD and damaged the northern provinces of Syria. It appears that the April or May 1035 AD earthquake was responsible for the seismic sea-wave. During this earthquake, extensive faulting and probably some crustal deformation occurred in the Saida-Sur area. (ref #26)</p>',\n",

Many houses collapsed causing a large number of deaths, and in many places large cracks opened into the ground, and clefts were formed. The sea overwhelmed many cities (Gallieni, lib. v, Q 2-6). Trebellius says also that these earthquakes occurred while a great pestilence raged in the east. The pestilence, which is also mentioned by Eusebius (Eccles. History, lib. vii, Q 22) together with the fact that at that time Gallienus was consul, fixes the time of this event in 262 AD. It does not seem certain that these earthquakes happened at the same time in Asia Minor and in Lybia. Nor that the inundations alluded to by Pollio took place in Asia Minor.

Thus, as for the 1754 Plinian eruption, a pyroclastic flow mechanism is more likely (Delos Reyes et al. 2018). However, atmospheric shock waves generated by the strongest explosions (Pratt 1911) are another possible source mechanism of the tsunamis. Moore et al. (1966) also related the tsunamis observed during the 1965 eruption to shock waves, although the transfer of energy from air to water (or phase-coupling) operates mostly on large areas of deep water (Yokoyama 1987), i.e., larger and deeper than Taal Caldera Lake.

The earthquake occurred near the northern end of a 3,000 km long segment of the Pacific/Australia plate boundary that trends north-northeast; farther north of the earthquake&#39;s source region, the plate boundary trends northwest and then west.

(ref. #6836)</p><p>Yet a large wave crashed later into the Chilean islands of Juan Fernandez, killing at least 8 people and leaving another 8 missing, the emergency office said. (ref. #6810)</p><p>While the Pacific basin was spared a major tsunami, there was major tsunami damage in Chile. In the coastal city of Talcahuano, where the surge reached nearly 5 m from peak to trough, a bizarre exchange took place: While even larger boats landed in the city centre, entire homes floated out to sea. &#39;The water swept aside everything that got in its way,&#39; said a resident of the small town of Boyecura. A wall of water swept across the Chilean island of Robinson Crusoe, 670 km off the coast, destroying many buildings and sweeping 5 people out to sea. Eleven others were missing. The Chilean Navy admitted it failed to give adequate tsunami warning to Robinson Crusoe, which lies in the Chilean archipelago of Juan Fernandez. (ref. #6811)</p><p>Islanders in the Chilean archipelago of Juan Fernandez felt a slight tremor early Saturday, one just like any other of those they hardly take notice of, and they slept on. Over the course of the morning, they saw on television the damage that the massive quake had caused in the city of Concepcion and elsewhere on the southern Chilean mainland. And then officials started waiting for information about a possible tsunami, but it ever came. Instead, as they saw the sea starting to rise, they rushed to switch on the sirens - but it was too late for some. The tsunami killed 5 people on the island, while 14 remained missing a day later, a toll that may have been avoided had the tsunami-detection and warning mechanisms been in order, some say. Upon hearing the sirens, some of the 629 residents of the village of Juan Bautista on Robinson Crusoe Is ran to the hills with no time for salvage. A wall of water - possibly nearly 5 metres high - ravaged everything in its way. Within a few minutes, the scene of the adventures of Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk - marooned on the island from 1704 to 1708, and immortalized in Daniel Defoe&#39;s novel Robinson Crusoe - had been razed to the ground. &#34;Everything that had been along that three-km stretch just disappeared,&#34; said Fernando Avaria, the first pilot to fly over the area after the disaster. The cemetery, the churches, sports facilities and the area&#39;s only school were reduced to planks of wood and broken glass. The buildings of the local authority simply disappeared. &#34;It was devastating, really out of a horror film,&#34; said Margot Salas, a local who toured the area with Chilean state television cameras almost 24 hours after the disaster. As the sea receded, Robinson Crusoe Is faced a new flood - one of despair. Mud covered everything within 3 km of the coast. (ref. #6812)</p>',\n",

Sea withdrawal along the coast in the Gulf of Naples. On December 17 at about midday a great earthquake (40 deg 49 min N 14 deg 26 min E) occurred and a large crack on the flank facing the sea caused a huge flow; in the meantime the sea withdrew for three times and then inundated the beach furiously. Near Sorrento the sea withdrew about 1 mile. (reference #4139)\\r\\n<p>1631 (1630), December 17. Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy, Bay of Naples. Earthquake  40 deg 50 min N, 14 deg 25 min E, intensity VII, tsunami intensity v, event validity 2. The earthquake occurred in Naples; Vesuvius erupted during the preceding night. After the earthquake, the sea near Naples, Sorrento, Island of Nisida and on the Island of Ischia receded from the coast by 1,000 yards (according to other data, by 100 yards), ships ran aground; then, part of them were thrown out onto the dry land and left there far away from the coast, some ships were wrecked. The level of the water near the fortress walls in Civitavecchia decreased by three palms of the hand. (reference #2130)\\r\\n</p><p>The most significant of these tsunamis seems to be that occurred in December 1631 during the great Vesuvian eruption (16-18 December) that was observed in the entire Gulf of Naples from Ischia to Sorrento and that began with a remarkable water withdrawal of more than 1000 yards followed by waves invading the coasts deep inland[...] The tsunami is depicted in the chronicles by Braccini (1632) and Giuliani (1632) who gave reports rather consistent with each other as regards the event time, the water first receding and then invading the coast three times, the vessels damaged and the boats destroyed[...] The generation mechanism of the Vesuvian tsunamis is not easy to define. There is no obvious relationship between the eruption magnitude and the magnitude of the ensuing tsunami[...] The hypothesis of a tsunami induced by an earthquake associated with the eruptive phases is not convincing too, since there is no sound evidence that the 1631 was immediately preceded by a shock the size needed to generate a tsunami. Subaerial or submarine landslides can be excluded. (reference #3347)\\r\\n</p><p>The cause- effect relationship between eruptive phenomena and the tsunami is not clear. However, the retreat of the waters did not seem to be linked to the nuees ardentes entering the sea, because authors reported that the nuees ardentes overflow from the crater was strictly contemporaneous with sea withdrawal.

Reference #150 lists the source of the tsunami that attacked Otsuchi as off Miyagi Prefecture.<p>\\r\\n</p><p>A Pacific tsunami flooded Japanese shores in January 1700. The waters drove villagers to high ground, damaged salt kilns and fishing shacks, drowned paddies and crops, ascended a castle moat, entered a government store house, washed away more than dozen buildings and spread flames that consumed twenty more. Return flows contributed to a nautical accident that sank tons of rice and killed two sailors. Samurai magistrates issued rice to afflicted villagers and requested lumber for those left homeless. A village headman received no advance warning from an earthquake; he wondered what to call the waves. (from p. 27 reference #2479)\\r\\n</p><p>Places flooded by the 1700 tsunami in Japan include Kuwagasaki, Tsugaruishi, Otsuchi, Miho and Tanabe. Some of the accounts mention damage in additional villages. In one account, the tsunami takes the form of rough seas that initiate a nautical accident near Nakaminato. (from p. 33 reference #2479)\\r\\n</p><p>A trans-Pacific reunion took place in 1996. Orphaned for nearly 300 years, the 1700 tsunami in Japan was reuinted, on the pages of a scientific journal, with an earthquake and tsunami in North America... The orphan dated the earthquake to the evening of January 26, 1700... and gave its approximate size as magnitude 9. (from p.93 reference #2479)\\r\\n</p><p>Today the 1700 tsunami is securely linked to a giant North American earthquake. The tie was strengthened in 1997 by tree-ring dating that narrowed the time window for a great Cascadia earthquake to the months between August 1699 and May 1700. The earthquake&#39;s enormity was confirmed in 2003 through improved estimates of the tsunami&#39;s size and from computer simulations of Cascadia earthquakes and of the tsunami itself... The tsunami&#39;s written record in Japan has become clearer too, with discovery in 1998 of the Miho headman&#39;s account, authentification in 2002 of the Nakaminato shipwreck certificate and explanation in 2004 of a discordant date from Tsugaruishi.

The earliest documented tsunami arrival time was around midnight on 27 January Japan time, or around 15:00 on 27 January GMT. Because tsunami travel time from Cascadia to Japan is about 10 hours, the earthquake origin time is estimated at around 5:00 27 January GMT or 21:00 on 26 January local time in Cascadia. This time is consistent with Native American legends that an earthquake occurred on a winter night. (reference #2654)</p>',\n",

Strabo says that when the water receded it left behind a pile of fish among the dead bodies. This battle probably took place about six years after Alexander Balas&#39; death in 145 BC.

However, Galanopoulos (1960) does not report a tsunami in Rhodes.

The wave washed over to Hat Island and drowned hundreds who ere clamming there. \\r\\n</p><p>...it is pointed out that the naming of known recent historical persons of one&#39;s own family gives a historical basis that cannot lightly be dismissed. The story would indicate a date of 1820-1830 for the incident.\\r\\n</p><p>The numbers given by John Brown could be exaggerations, but it is certain that the clam beds at Camano Head and the northern end of Hat Island always have been the most important beds in the Snohomish area. Hence, being early on summer morning before the people were all up, the casualties may indeed have been very heavy, even running into hundreds, especially at the Head itself from which there was no escape.\\r\\n</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11939:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>The accounts also mention that some flooding may have occurred at Hibolb (a larger village on the northern Everett shoreline near the mouth of the Snohomish), but if damage occurred at all, it was limited. No mention is made of the wave at other low-lying sites in the vicinity, such as Sandy Point on Whidbey Island - the closest barrier beach and marsh to Camano Head.\\r\\n</p><p>Although the accounts leave many questions unanswered, the following seems fairly clear. Early on a summer morning in the early 1800s, a large landslide occurred at Camano Head, carrying standing trees to the beach, and burying many people living at the toe of the bluff. The landslide sounded like thunder and created large volumes of dust. The landslide also resulted in a tsunami that traveled south toward Hat Island, washing over the barrier beach, destroying houses or encampments and drowning many people.\\r\\n</p><p>The accounts make no mention of ground shaking, suggesting that the landslide was not associated with a major earthquake.\\r\\n</p><p>The Camano Head landslide is the only known example of a landslide on Puget Sound generating a tsunami large enough to cause significant loss of life.\\r\\n</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11942:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>One of the Snohomish villages was located beneath a bluff at the southern tip of Camano Island, Camano Head.

At first, \\x91it was theorized by some that construction activity in the harbor caused the initial landslide. However, this paper presents the findings of an in-depth scientific investigation that concludes that such a theory is impossible. The findings paint a clear picture of the failure of the submerged Skagway River delta that was overloaded by flood sediments and exacerbated by river diking. Slide volumes estimated at over 20,000,000 cubic yards that consisted of a massive initial slide and subsequent retrogressive earth slides produced the tsunami that caused the fatality and destroyed or damaged harbor structures. \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #1315:</i></blockquote>\\r\\n<p>A negative tide of 1.2 m at 7:10 pm local time was the probable cause of a submarine landslide-generated tsunami that caused about $25 million damage and one fatality in Skagway Harbor, Alaska. It produced a tsunami of nine to eleven meters. Because the event was not associated with an earthquake, there was about a year delay before the tsunami community became aware of the event.\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #234:</i></blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The landslide was accompanied by a series of large-amplitude, high frequency sea level oscillations estimated by eyewitnesses to be 5-6 m in height in the inlet and 9-11 m at the shoreline. \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #11885:</i></blockquote>\\r\\n<p>On November 3, 1994, at about 7:10 p.m., a tsunami wave with a period of about 3 minutes and maximum height of 25 to 30 feet occurred in the Taiya Inlet at Skagway, Alaska as reported by Lander(1). The event occurred at the time of a low tide of 4 feet below lower low level. The tidal range at Skagway is about 25 feet.\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #12143:</i></blockquote>\\r\\n<p>This report by an eyewitness, remote from the work site, confirms two things: 1) the drawdown (trough), not a crest, occurred first in upper Taiya Inlet; and 2) a change in air mass movement (wind) occurred before the drawdown reached the small boat harbor. \\r\\n</p><p>The &#34;wall of water&#34; which came northward toward the end of the old north dock, appeared to come over the tops of the tail wall sheet piles as they disappeared, hence a slide at the construction site could not have caused the &#34;wall of water.&#34;\\r\\n</p><p>Since the tide level was -5 feel MLLW at the time, the wave crest was approximately 30 feet above the tide elevation.\\r\\n</p><p>The seafloor surveys taken before and after the event disclose that <b>about 23 million cubic yards of material slid or flowed in the upper Taiya Inlet during the November 3, 1994 seafloor instability</b>, which lasted only seconds.</p>'},\n",

After a period of extraordinary activity of the volcano of Stromboli which started in Feb, its powerful explosion occurred with a noise of unprecedented intensity and with the discharge of enormous puffs of black smoke that enveloped the entire island for a short time. Anyone trying to move was knocked down. The explosion was accompanied by water being blown up from the sea and flooding the coast, everything around was overturned, and all the ships were carried approximately 300m up to vineyards adjacent to the coast. The tsunami waves were generated (evidently, owing to a sudden increase of the atmospheric pressure). &#34;The displacement of water, like during a weak tsunami, was observed on the Island of Ustica. First, a whirlpool appeared in the sea in the Piccolo Lagoon of the Island of Capri, i.e. in the part of the island facing the Island of Stromboli, and reefs usually covered with water were uncovered for 1 m, and then, 6-7 s later, powerful waves gushed over the normal water line. Oscillations of the sea level of a very low amplitude (0.5 cm) with a period of about 11 min were recorded by the tide gauge stalled at the lighthouse [Faro] near Messina after l8h and lasted 90 min; they resumed half an hour later and lasted 30 min more. The tide gauge in Messina recorded usual sea waves with a period of 7-8 min, but of a low amplitude - about 1 cm, 2 cm maximum - during the eruption. Oscillations of a much higher amplitude started approximately at 18h, and the amplitude reached 7.5 cm 20min later; after that, the waves caused by the eruption started to subside, but continued about 3 hours more. No signs of tsunami in the records of the tide gauges in the towns of Palermo, Catania, Cagliari (Sardinia Is), Naples, on the Island of Ischia, in the town of Civitavecchia were revealed.

There was a powerful eruption of the Awu Volcano on Sangihe Island, which generated, so far as can be judged from the fragmentary data, joint gravitational oscillations of the atmosphere and the hydrosphere of the same type as the waves from the Krakatau explosion and corresponding oscillations in level [seiche type?] in the internal seas in Indonesia.</p><p>The eruption began at 18:10 without any preliminary phenomena. A huge column of smoke rose over the volcano. Lightning flashed. It rained with a mixture of ashes. This soon became a real ash and rock fall.\\r\\n</p><p>The explosion of the volcano was not accompanied by noticeable tremors of the island. The eruption reached extraordinary power at about 21:00. After this, the fall of pumice stopped, and the ashfall also diminished by midnight. Soon after the eruption, boiling mud flows saturated with hydrogen sulfide, presumably formed as a result of the emptying of the crater lake, rushed along the crevices which furrowed the slopes of the volcano. As a result of the eruption, <b>1,532 people died</b> on the island, or 2% of its population, since many huts collapsed under the weight of ejecta, while others were washed away by the streams. The northern part of the island suffered considerably more than the southern. Gardens, kitchen-gardens, and coconut plantations were buried.</p><p>The loud noises of the explosions of the volcano were heard on\\r\\nTernate Island from 18:00 to 22:00 and then at night until 2:00. At Manado, several explosions were heard for half an hour after 18:30, and flames flickered on the horizon to the north. At Tolitoli and Donggala, and also at many parts in the southern and eastern regions of Sulawesi Is. and on Kabia Island, including Makassar and Maros and on Timor\\r\\nIsland, at 19:30 and later, very faint muffled booms were heard, like distant artillery fire. Similar sounds were heard at 20:30 at Ambon and at night on Flores Is., at Larantuka.</p><p>The sound wave was followed by a gravitation wave, which caused perceptible tremors at a number of places. Prolonged faint trembling of the ground was felt in the evening on Ternate Is. At Makassar at 1:57, tremors 3-4 degrees in strength were registered. Similar oscillations were registered at Maros and in general in the southern and eastern regions of Sulawesi Is. and on Kabia Is. At Bima, on Sumbawa Is., very strong horizontal oscillations were felt from 2:05 to 2:15, and very weak [ground] waves were felt at 5:10 and at 8:10. Several huts collapsed on Flores Is. at Reo. At Maumere, horizontal oscillations lasting 2 minutes were felt at 2:30; one hut collapsed. At Ende, strong oscillations were felt at 1:00. At Larantuka, horizontal tremors lasting 2 minutes were felt at 2:30; one residence collapsed.</p><p>At Surabaja at 1:34, the pendulum of the astronomical clock stopped.</p><p>At Djakarta (Batavia), the magnetograph registered an earthquake at 1:17 and then at 1:21 and 6:00.</p><p>Oscillations in sea level were noticed at Bonthain, Bulukumba and Salajar; the only consequence was minor damage to one boat in the Tanga River at Bonthain.</p><p>At Bima, oscillations in level were noticeable at 3:00. The water rose high at the entrance to the bay; this was accompanied by a loud noise, which was even heard in the home of the local superintendent, a 2-hour walk away. This rustling lasted 20 minutes, after which the water began to rise very quickly. The highest rise of water was observed at 5:00, when there should have been an ebb.</p><p>A weak tsunami was observed at 7:00 in Ambon Bay. In a few minutes, the water level oscillated from the highest to the lowest level, with a range of more than 1.5 m.\\r\\n</p><p>The ashes ejected during the explosion settled on a considerable area to the south of Sangihe Is. A ship traveling to Sangihe Is. from Ternate Is. was covered with ashes; ashes fell on Likupang. At Donggala and Makassar, much ash fell on the 8th from 3:00 until sunset.</p>',\n",

The town was inundated and the sea advanced inland. Where the town once was, is now a bay in which ships lie at anchor. The town was rebuilt 1 km from the ocean shore. According to other reports, all houses in the town were washed away, but the more solidly constructed fortifications stood up.

Large damage occurred in the capital Amaxike. As it results from a memorial tablet in the wall of the Latin church Pantokrator, which was located in the fortress of Leukada and was built by Varbarigo Balbo in 1733, this church was pulled down by the earthquake. In the same note of Kontarini, it is written that at 2h in the night an earthquake occurred and it was near to destroy all houses in Lixuri. The sea rushed in the land and then withdrew. It caused damage in the northern and western part of Cephallonia, mainly in Palike, in Erisos, and in Argostoli. In Zante and Arta the earthquake was felt as very violent and as violent in Patra.

The oscillations in level apparently began here with a\\r\\nsmall ebb tide. It was observed throughout the Pacific Basin including Samoa, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Mexico and California. The tsunami was observed at all the islands of the Hawaiian archipelago. The tsunami caused fatalities in Hawaii and Japan.

There was a destructive earthquake and catastrophic tsunami with source off the northern coast of Chile. This is sometimes mentioned in the literature as the Iquique tsunami. At Iquique at 20:20, a slight booming rumble was heard, accompanied by slow oscillations of the ground, which soon became terrible tremors lasting about 4 minutes. It was impossible to stand without holding on to something. A cloud of dust arose in the air. A fire was\\r\\nstarted by overturned lamps in the southern part of the city. However, it was soon extinguished. This earthquake was considered stronger than any previously felt in the city [7 degrees]. There was a similar earthquake at San Pedro, accompanied by a terrible rumble. Buildings were partially destroyed, and many inhabitants were confused, but no one died, since people had time to run from their homes [7-8 degrees]. Tarapaca, Mamina, Pica, La Horia, La Tarama, Conchones, and Punta Lobos were more or less destroyed [7]. At Caleta Pabellon de Pica, the earthquake lasted 5 minutes with increasing force. More than 10 fires were started by overturned lamps. The fires were extinguished by the flood. <b>Thirty-three workers died in a\\r\\nlandslide</b>. Furniture and lamps were overturned; fires broke out. Colossal chunks of rock fell from the mountain sides; cracks up to 15 m deep in places opened up in the ground. According to reports, <b>30 workers were buried</b> in a guano pit. A slight shock was felt here three or four days before the earthquake. The guano grooves caved in at Huanillos. All homes were destroyed. Tocopilla was destroyed. <b>Forty miners (according to later reports, only three or four) died</b> when a shaft collapsed 8 km south of the city. At Cobija, almost all adobe houses were damaged or destroyed. People were thrown to the ground [7-81. The earthquake lasted 3-8 minutes; all the furnaces collapsed at Caracoles.

Punta Arenas earthquake. A foreshock was felt at about 02:50 a.m. The intensity at Punta Arenas was around 7; no casualties occurred in the town itself. Most of the damage was due to the collapse of firewalls between wooden houses. No damage was reported from the oilfields on Tierra del Fuego Island. About 2 dozen aftershocks were felt the first day. Landslides occurred along the west coast of Tierra del Fuego, particularly at San Nicolas, in Admiralty Bay, and along the banks of lake Fagnano and the Belverde River. Three persons were killed at a lumber mill which was destroyed by a large landslide at San Nicolas, about 50 km south of Punta Arenas. Jets of salt water were reported squirting from the ground at that locality. Local tsunami waves and abnormally strong tidal currents were observed on Porvenir, in Admiralty Bay, in the Zigzag Channel near Gabriel Canal, and at other points. The epicenter was located presumably on tho fault structure which includes Lake Fagnano and the western arm of the Magellan Straits; but it was closer to Lake Fagnano than to Punta Arenas. The magnitude was 7.5. (reference #252)\\r\\n</p><p>1949, December 17, 06:53 UTC. 54 S, 71 W, magnitude 7.7 MS, depth 33 km.

Fifteen houses were destroyed, 22 &#34;affected&#34;; 2 boats were destroyed and 23 damaged. All along the affected area many temporary beach structures (kiosks) made of grass mats were swept away or damaged. Many boats were displaced, most dramatically from Samanco Bay south of Chimbote, where boats were displaced 300 m inland and remained beached there at the time of our survey. At Culebras, an unreinforced brick harbor wall was pushed over by the tsunami. At Coishco, some brick houses\\r\\nwere damaged, several reinforced brick:concrete factory walls were partially destroyed, and 400 tons of fish meal stored behind a brick and concrete wall were damaged or destroyed. <b>The fatalities including six line fishermen on the rocks at Coishco (Caleta Santa), four persons gathering firewood at the mouth of the Santa River, and two children on the beach looking for gold at Campo Santa.</b> The Civil Defense reported that evacuation took place in the Chimbote area after the earthquake and as the water retreated on the morning of 21 February. All deaths were in isolated regions, and it is unknown whether tsunami victims felt the earthquake, knew if they did to expect a tsunami, or saw the tsunami coming. \\r\\n<p>The tsunami on 21 February arrived at approximately mid-tide, on an outgoing tide. Throughout the surveyed region normal tidal range is between about 0.7 and\\r\\n1.1 m. \\r\\n</p><p>Since the tide gauge of Chimbote saturated after the initial rise of the tsunami, and the Salaverry and Callao records are truncated, eyewitness reports are invaluable.\\r\\nThe wave was generally described as black with no indications of breaking, occasionally with a hissing sound. Many recalled either two or three waves, usually in quick succession, with the second being the largest. The time between waves varied and at Coishco was reported near 8 min, at La Posa Huanchaco 9 minutes, at Playa Chimus 25 minutes. Many interviewees noted that during (and after) the\\r\\ntsunami the water became more turbulent, with bigger waves and a dirtier appearance. In El Dorado and Puerto Supe, eyewitnesses pointed to rocks and dock structures beyond which the water withdrew first. A number of eyewitnesses noted that the water remained high (or ponded) for 2-3 days.\\r\\n</p><p>(above from reference #48)</p>',\n",

A large Tokachi-oki earthquake occurred at the southern coast of Hokkaido, Japan. The earthquake generated large tsunamis causing damage along the southern coast of Hokkaido. The largest tsunami height was 4 m to the east of Cape Erimo, around Bansei-onsen, and locally at Mabiro. The large tsunamis arrived at the Pacific side of the coast of Hokkaido and Tohoku about 2-3 hours after the time of the high tide. In general, the tsunami run-up heights were gradually decreased to the east and to the west away from those two places except Mabiro where the large tsunami height about 4 m is locally observed. The tsunamis generated by the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake were observed at tide gauges in eastern Hokkaido and the northern Tohoku regions. The large later phase observed at the tide gauge in Urakawa is the edge wave propagating from Cape Erimo along the west coast of the Hidaka area.\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #3819:</i></blockquote>\\r\\nAt the Tokachi harbor, several cars parked at the quays were washed away by the tsunami.

Several ships collided or were washed away by the tsunamis. The most intensive tsunami survey was conducted in this region.

Aegean Sea, eastern Greece. Island of Euboea, Gulf of Maliacus. Evidence provided by Thucidides indicates that a series of earthquakes occurred in the regions of Attica, Boeotia, Euboea in the autumn of 427 B.C. ... Several shocks in the summer and autumn of 426 B.C. occurred in the strait separating the Euboea Island from the continent. </p><p>According to eyewitness Demetrios Kallatianos, a significant part of the Lichades Island and the Cape Cenaeon sank under water. The shore near Orobies also sank and the coastal line shifted deep into dry land. The base of one of the peninsulas opposite the continental shore sank, and the Island of Atalanti appeared (Talantonissi). </p><p>After one of the earthquakes, the sea in Orobies retreated from the coastal line, but later on, coming back in the form of huge &#34;swelling&#34;, it partly flooded the settlement and this was repeated many times. According to Strabo, the waves flooded the shore three times, penetrating the continental coast of Greece 3-4 miles inland. Gullies in the vicinity of Tarfi, Thronium, Thermoplyles and Daphus were flooded, and many settlements were destroyed. A similar flood took place on the Atalanti Island: here, waves caught up triremes and dragged them along the shore for more than 2 miles; another trireme was torn away from a moorage and smashed against the walls. The sea also retreated from the coast in Peparithos and Skopelos, too, but no flood accompanied this process. The wave was observed in Opus near Kiparissi. On the eastern shore of Euboea Island no waves were observed. Judging from descriptions, a tectonic collapse occurred in the strait between the Euboea Island and the continent, resulting in great seiches. One must agree with Antonopoulos that possible local landslides of friable material were not the main cause of variations in the water level in the strait.\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Ref #4139:</i></blockquote>\\r\\n<p>426 BC June, earthquake magnitude 7.1, intensity X, 38 deg 54 min N, 22 deg 42 min E, tsunami intensity v, event validity 4.

According to the captain, lava covered half the island, causing numerous victims among the population.\\r\\n</p><p>Another schooner, the &#34;Ariel,&#34; which had been situated off neighboring Eromanga Island, brought a report on passing Port de France on August 26 that the shock of August 17 was felt on Eromanga Island with great force and was accompanied by an unusual movement of the sea. A large wave made the schooner &#34;dance&#34; on its anchors, putting it in extreme danger. This wave must have done great damage on land, but the captain could not give any information about this, since they did not land. At this time, there were no Europeans on the New Hebrldes, and no written reports could be received from the islands about the earthquake and volcano eruption.\\r\\n</p><p>According to the director of the astronomic observatory at Port de France, the earthquake of August 17 on New Caledonia was felt most strongly at Kanala and Vagap.

There was a very strong earthquake (4.25 S, 152.25 E) along the coast of Blanche Bay, including at Rabaul. It was barely felt on the Duke of York Islands (30 km east of Rabaul). The earthquake was accompanied by two tsunami waves, which washed out a large section of the coast of Matupi Island (according to other sources, the earthquake occurred two days before the tsunami). \\r\\n</p><p>Soon after the earthquake, clouds of steam could be seen rising out of the water along the line joining the Raluan Volcano and the Tawurwur (Ghaie) Volcano. An hour later, the old crater of the Ghaie Volcano exploded with &#34;terrible force.&#34; Flames and enormous masses of smoke and ashes were ejected. There were apparently <b>no lava flows</b>. A thick layer of ash and pumice covered the coast and Saint George&#39;s Channel. At Ghaie, a new cone was formed. At the site of the underwater eruption, a cone-shaped, but rather flat elevation 20 m high formed out of loose material. This later became Raluan (Baluan) Island. The eruption of the Raluan Volcano lasted three days, during which time total darkness reigned; fishes and turtles died. The eruption of the Ghaie Volcano lasted three weeks. Due to the prevailing northwest winds, the ejecta settled mainly in the sea, and on land only the regions immediately adjoining the volcanoes suffered. Blanche Bay and Saint George&#39;s Channel were plugged up with islands of floating pumice for a month.\\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #99:</i></blockquote>\\r\\n<p>1878, February 4. The eruption of 1878 is well described by both Dr. George Brown and Dr. Wilfred Powell. Dr. Brown writes that it was reported to him on the 30th January that the old volcano in Blanche was in eruption. On the other hand, in his description he says that on Sunday night, the 3rd February, very violent earthquakes were felt, followed by tidal waves on the Monday morning. Soon afterwards, clouds of steam were seen rising from the bay in a direct line between Tavurvur and Vulcan, and as the submarine crater increased in strength, these steam clouds ceased and the old crater burst out with terrific power. </p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #79:</i></blockquote>\\r\\n<p>1878, February.

Five Indians, who were on a small island near the foot of one of the glaciers, were drowned in the tidal wave caused by the falling ice&#34; (The Alaskan, Sitka, September 29, 1900, p. 4). The description sounds like a report by survivors. Miller (1960, p. 74) mentions a flood in Lituya Bay reported by fishermen to him in 1952. The flood destroyed a native fish saltery near the mouth of\\r\\nthe bay and occurred about 1899. There are three, not five, glaciers feeding Lituya Bay: Lituya, Cascade and North Crillon.

At least 3 people killed and 7 missing due to a 7.6 meter tsunami caused by rockslides falling into a narrow fjord near Puerto Aisen. Felt (VII) at Puerto Aisen and Puerto Chacabuco, (VI) at Coihaique, (V) at Balmaceda and (IV) at Cochrane. (reference #1053) \\r\\n<p>The earthquake in the Region of Aysen generated landslides between the Island Mentirosa and Ri&#39;o Cuervo, generating a mass of earth that fell into the sea causing waves of great size that affected the coastal sectors and the salmon plants of the fiord of Aysen. Three people were killed and seven are missing. (ref #2684)\\r\\n</p><p>The earthquake produced a landslide in the fjord area close to Puerto Chacabuco. The landslide generated 3 waves, the biggest was about 6 meters and affected a local area. A tide gauge recorded only a 0.8 m. variation (10 km away from the landslide). (ref #2686)\\r\\n</p><p>On 21 April 2007, an Mw 6.2 earthquake produced an unforeseen chain of events in the Aysen fjord (Chilean Patagonia, 45.5 S). The earthquake triggered hundreds of subaerial landslides along the fjord flanks. Some of the landslides eventually involved a subaqueous component that, in turn, generated a series of displacement waves-tsunami- like waves produced by the fast entry of a subaerial landmass into a water body-within the fjord. These waves, with run-ups several meters high along the shoreline, caused 10 fatalities. In addition, they severely damaged salmon farms, which constitute the main economic activity in the region, setting free millions of cultivated salmon with still unknown ecological consequences... The combined results from all of these studies show that the large destructive waves were likely generated by the concurrent effects of the entry of subaerial landslides into the water body, the subaqueous destabilization of the fjord flanks linked to coastline retreat, and the sudden generation of the compressional ridges, which implied a vertical displacement of the fjord floor of up to 15 meters. (ref #10839)\\r\\n</p><p>April 1 (Ms 5,4) which triggered a small tsunami and caused some minor damages to the salmon farms near the epicentral zone. As a consequence, debris flows and tsunamis caused the death of three people and the disappearance of seven, in addition to severe damages to the salmon industry installations. The main areas affected by the tsunami were Punta Tortuga (one missing person), the mouth of Río Pescado, and Playa Blanca (Fig. 7; three dead and three missing people), the mouth of Rio Cuervo, Punta Camello (Caleta Dagny y Ensenada La Perra, one missing person), Isla Mentirosa, the mouths of Frío and Fernández rivers, Punta Yelcho, Caleta Bluff and Bahia Acantilada. <b>Note: reference #9790 clarifies that deaths were not all at this single location and that two deaths were due to landslides, not tsunami.</b>(ref #9790)\\r\\n</p><p>The displaced water masses formed swells estimated between 5 to 10 m in height for Aguas Calientes and probably more than 10 m for Isla Mentirosa, which seems to have been after the first wave. From these, in seconds, waves of tsunami were generated that reached speeds of radial propagation estimated between 360 and 600 km/h. The displaced waters left marks by direct impact of up to 50 m in the northern part of the Isla Mentirosa. The areas most impacted by the tsunami waves are: Punta Tortuga, mouth of Rio Pescado, Playa Blanca, mouth of Rio Cuervo, Punta Camello, Isla Mentirosa, estuary mouths of Frio and Fernandez, Punta Yelcho, Caleta Bluff and Bahia Acantilada.

       "  'comments': '1853-1854. Validity 4 with some uncertainty on the date. A massive wave in Lituya Bay cleared trees to a height of 120 meters.  The occurrence of the wave is evidenced by a well-marked zone in the forest on either shore of the bay, the demarcation line of which separates two tree populations of differing ages.  Growth ring dating of the younger, lower trees indicated that a wave had cleared the forest between the growing season of August 1853 and May 1854. It is believed that the wave was generated by a rockslide on the south shore of the bay.  The report of many drowned at Dry Bay between 1850 and 1860 is probably associated with this tsunami. Native histories variously suggest from 8-10 war canoes with 8 men each were lost, to the loss of an entire village, as possible results of this event. It is tempting to combine these events with the poorly dated account of the 1845 glacier collapse in Disenchantment Bay and the 1847 Sitka earthquake. However, the tree-ring date for the Lituya Bay seems to fix that event to near the 1853-1854 period but an under-counting is possible. Therefore, these are considered as separate events [1845-1847 and 1853-1854]; the Lituya Bay event does not seem to have been associated with an earthquake. This is the earliest of five landslide tsunamis reported for Lituya Bay by Miller (1960). (Ref #239)\\r\\n<p>The following is from reference #415:\\r\\n</p><p>1853/1854. During studies in Lituya Bay, mainly in 1948 and in 1952-1953, clear traces of the past effects of a strong wave were found. Namely, along the northern and in places along the southern shore of the Bay, an age-old forest grew, beginning only at a certain well-marked boundary. Below this boundary and as far as the zone of flood tides, there grew only a young forest. Judging by the number of rings on trunk sections, it was established that the wave arose between the middle of August 1853 and the beginning of May 1854.\\r\\n</p><p>The maximal known height of this boundary is 120 m (395 feet) above mean sea level; the maximal distance from the water line is 750 m (2500 feet); the known area of the zone of destruction of forest is 3 1/2 km squared. Judging from the remaining traces of erosion, the destructive force of the wave of 1853/1854 was little less than that of the waves of 1958. \\r\\n</p><p>According to Indian legend, in the 60&#39;s of the XIX century, at the exit from Lituya Bay, eight canoes with people were lost in a sudden flood. The cause of the waves is unknown.</p>',\n",

In this paper we review the potential causes for this landslide based on an integrated study of eye witness testimony, swath bathymetry data and stability analyses. Results show that the Sokkelvik landslide was most likely triggered by intense rainfall and snowmelt, but that the main cause is associated to the load of an up to 7.5 m high embankment fill. This fill was placed at the shoreline for road construction 6 months before the landslide. Results presented herein show the importance of accounting for extreme rainfall events and groundwater flow when planning construction activity in sensitive near shore areas.

According to the description, the wave impacted the Levantine coast with effects recorded at Caesarea and Yavne. The tsunami was likely caused by a powerful earthquake that destroyed the city of Antioch (Ambraseys and Jackson, 1998) and originated somewhere along the eastern Cyprean Arc (Ben-Avraham et al., 1995). The construction of Caesarea&#39;s harbor by Herod the Great in 21 B.e. is well documented by excavation work and descriptions of the harbor by the historian Josephus Flavius (Whiston, 1999; Holum et al., 1988). The reasons for the rapid decline in the harbor, about one century later, are less c1ear, and heavily debated (Reinhardt and Raban, 1999; Hohlfelder, 2000). However, the favored interpretation has been the catastrophic destruction of the harbor by an earthquake; although the role of a tsunami has been considered, no conclusive evidence has ever been found (Raban, 1992, 1999; Reinhardt and Raban, 1999; Mart and Perecman, 1996). Records of sub-recent (past 2000 yr) tsunamis in the eastern Mediterranean are based primarily on textual records with variable accuracy (e.g., Neev et al., 1973; Amiran et al., 1994; Mart and Perecman, 1996; Ambraseys and Jackson, 1998; Karcz, 2004), none of which has been substantiated with geological or archaeological evidence.

       "  'comments': '1751, May (erroneously March) 24 or 25 (after 01:00, local time) there was a destructive earthquake and tsunami in Concepcion. The shock that occurred on the 26th was almost as strong as that of the 25th.<p>The ocean began to recede about half an hour after the quake, and soon the half dressed, frozen and frightened inhabitants of Concepcion climbed the neighbouring hills from where they witnessed the approach of a strong sea wave descending upon the shore. The tsunami flooded the town (then situated in the site of Penco), and washed away the wreckage of buildings and domestic utensils. Seven minutes later the ocean returned with great force &#34;the waves crowded one on another,&#34; and the water level exceeded its usual limits; the water burst into the town with a speed exceeding that of a galloping horse, completely inundating the town. The water advanced quickly along the river, rising and inundating the adjacent areas and flooding even houses on higher ground. Boats and canoes were hurled into the church of San Francisco, located 400-500 m from shore. Subsequently, the water receded, again quite rapidly, carrying with it walls, some of which were still intact, and household items. Where the town had stood there was nothing but an impassable heap of ruins. And in the Cantarranos quarter, only the piles of the houses were left, all the rest having been washed away. Then the water receded again, just as on the previous occasion, but it rose and inundated the area two more times, the third flooding being the most severe. </p><p>The next morning it was established that the water level had varied considerably; in some areas the water had risen more than 3.5 m (4 varas), in others less. <b>Twenty-five to thirty old persons and invalids (17 persons, according to other accounts) were drowned</b> in the waves of the tsunami - the only victims of the earthquake. </p><p>The vessel &#34;St. Anthony and Family,&#34; loaded with goods and passengers, lay at anchor in the port of Concepcion. The seaquake was very severe and it was feared the vessel might be destroyed, but it survived. With the first strong ebb, the anchor chain broke, and the ship itself was grounded, listing heavily. The returning tide hit the vessel, causing it to list the other way. Then the vessel found itself floating. Subsequently, the sea rose 17 m (9 1/2 fathoms) and the ship was thus refloated. There were three strong tides and ebbs, and each time the vessel became grounded. </p><p>After this destructive flood - the fourth and most severe in the history of the city - Concepcion was rebuilt farther  from the shore, and its old location was eventually used to build the new town of Penco. The tsunami was also recorded in Valparaiso. </p><p>The waves hit the island of Juan Fernandez, washed away a settlement and sank a vessel anchored in the port. <b>The governor of the island, his family along with 35 other persons perished</b>. </p><p>The tsunami reached threatening proportions in Callao; but no one died</p><p>There are some reports to the effect that the bottom of Concepcion Bay had risen 7 m (24 feet) during the earthquake; the resulting shoal consisted of hard sandstone rather than sand.</p><p>Naturalists who later visited the area of Concepcion, found, in areas of considerable elevation, many mollusc shells which were packed with river sand; such shells normally occur in the littoral zone.</p><p>The tsunami reached the southeastern coast of the island of Honshu, flooding the houses on Otsuki on the Djika peninsula and in Kesennuma to above the floors, but there were no deaths.\\r\\n</p><p>(above from reference #415)</p>',\n",

       "  'comments': 'In 1783 Calabria (southern Italy) was shaken by the most violent and persistent seismic crisis occurred in the last two thousands years. Five very strong earthquakes occurred in a short interval of time (February-March), causing destructions and a lot of victims in a vast region embracing the whole southern Calabria and the Messina area, Sicily. Very likely the earthquake is not directly responsible for the tsunami (at the epicentre, waves observed about half an hour later than the ground shaking). Tsunami probably due to a huge earthquake-induced rockfall: a portion of the Monte Campalla (south-western side of the Scilla beach) collapsed into the sea. The front of the failing mass was about 450 m long and penetrated the sea at most by 100 m (Minasi, ref #4125). On the other hand, it was estimated to be more than 2 km long with detachment occurring at a distance ranging from 500 to 2 km onshore and penetreting the sea by a distance of 110 m (De Lorenzo, ref #4132).\\r\\n<p>At Scilla most of the people, frightened by the sequence of earthquakes, escaped to the open beach and were surprised by the unexpected waves that reached the roof of the buildings. Total number of tsunami <b>victims exceeding 1500</b> (Galimi, ref #4126; Mercalli, ref #4134). Few seconds after the rockfall the sea inundated the district of Marina Grande, reaching the first ffloor of buildings, then it the cliffs of the Castle at Monasina. The water climbed the Livorno stream op to 200 m from the sea shore, then reached Chianalea and Marina dell&#39;Oliveto, located on the other side of the promontory. Three big inundations were observed. At Marina Grande the Santo Spirito church was destroyed, the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, located at a distance of 90m from the shore was inundated as well as San Nicola church. A woman entangled in a mulberry tree at an height of 8.3 m near the Gornelle fountain. According to Sarconi (ref #4124) in Marina Grande (Scilla) inundation heights in the range of 6-9 m observed, while according to Minasi (ref #4125) wave height of 16 m. At Nicotera the sea withdrew then inundated the shore carrying some fishing boats. Also Bagnara affected by the inundation. Cannitello was affected by the waves. At Messina the sea was seen to rise and noisily overflow its coast. According to Minasi (ref #4125) sea level rose of about 2 m. Tsunami also quite relevant at the headlight. At Peloro, near Torre del Faro, flooding of a long stretch of fields, close to the Pantanello small lake. Small houses, people and animals carried seaward. At Torre del Faro coast flooded for about 600 paces. Some boats and 26 victims carried seaward. Run-up height about 6 m. At Punta del Pezzo and surrounding areas sea covering the beach for one and a half mile, leaving some sand on the ground.

The river fell as rapidly as it had risen and receded within its banks with such violence that it took with it a grove of cotton wood trees. A great many fish were left upon the banks.

On the Mississippi great waves were created, which overwhelmed many boats and washed\\r\\nothers high upon the shore, the return current breaking off thousands of trees and carrying them out into the river.\\r\\nHigh banks caved and were precipitated into the river, sand bars and points of islands gave way, and whole islands\\r\\ndisappeared. (Fuller, 1912)\\r\\n</p><p>Unusual lake water level rises were seen at Lake Bistineau near Texas-Louisiana border. Lake Caddo, in the\\r\\nsame area, was probably formed as a result of the earthquake and accompanying subsidence.\\r\\n(http://www.lakebistineau.com/history/1919article.html, http://www.ops.tamu.edu/x075bb/caddo/caddo.html.)\\r\\n</p><p>At Orchard Lake, Michigan, it was reported that on December 17, 1911 &#34;the Indians said the waters of the\\r\\nlake began to boil, bubble, foam and roll about as though they had been in a large kettle over a hot fire, and that in\\r\\na few minutes up came great numbers of turtles, and hurried to shore, upon which they had a great turtle feast.&#34;\\r\\n(Hobbs, 1911; Bricker, 1977) Validity 3.\\r\\n</p><p>(above from reference #541)\\r\\n</p><p>On the river a number were drowned. Bradbury mentions seeing drifting canoes, the owners of which he afterward found had been lost. Hildreth describes the loss of several boats and their crews by caving banks. Lloyd records that a flat boat belonging to Richard Stump was swamped and six men drowned. Many other boats were destroyed by snags and the river was covered with wrecks. So numerous were the disasters that the escape and arrival at Natchez of Capt. Roosevelt with the steamer New Orleans was regarded as almost miraculous. (reference #1854)</p>',\n",

       "  'comments': '1843. A tsunami occurred in the southern Kurile Islands and at Hokkaido.\\r\\n<p>The original account of the tsunami at Urup I. must be in the archives of the Russian-American Company. There are in existence two published accounts: Perrey (there is a Russian translation in Mushketov and Orlov, 1893) and P.N. Doroshin (1870).\\r\\n</p><p>Perrey got the account from F. P. Osten-Saken, secretary of the Russian Geographic Society in the &#39;60s and at the same time a responsible official in the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At Perrey&#39;s request, Osten-Saken reviewed the records of the Russian-American Company for the years 1840-1860 and sent him all of the information that he found there concerning seismic and volcanic phenomena in the territories of the company.\\r\\n</p><p>P.N. Doroshin compiled a list of earthquakes in the same territories for the years 1840-1866 on the basis of similar material and also of his own notes which he made during his service with the Company.\\r\\n</p><p>Below we present the text of Doroshin with small additions from the text of Osten-Saken.\\r\\n</p><p>&#34;On April 13, 1843, at Urup at sunrise there were two strong shocks three seconds apart. They were preceded by a roar like distant thunder. The shocks came from the southwest and continued for seven seconds. After about three [?] minutes, with a fresh west wind, the water began to flow with terrible swiftness out of the bay [Aleutka] where the settlement was located, and the bottom of the bay was left completely dry. Then with the same speed the bay again filled with water and even inundated the shore to a considerable height. For several days the water was in constant movement; now it would come in, now go down, and each change was accompanied by a strong rip (agitation from the meeting of the currents).&#34;\\r\\n</p><p>This earthquake, apparently was one of the catastrophic ones, as it was observed on all of the southern Kurile Island and on the east coast of Hokkaido. In the Nemuro and Kushiro areas the earthquake attained destructive force. Thus, it is reported that in the town of Akkeshi, situated between these two points, one of the tombs was moved 1.5 m.; in the temple grounds fissures 10-15 cm. wide were formed. The earthquake was followed by destructive tsunamis; in the Kushiro area the height of the waves was 4.5 m. Especially affected by the tsunamis were the villages located on the shores of Akkeshi Bay which has the shape of a bent funnel, penetrating deeply into the land. In the village of Shinryu, at the bend of the funnel, all of the houses were washed away by the waves and <b>45 persons perished</b>.\\r\\n</p><p>According to Japanese estimates, the intensity (magnitude) of the earthquake was M &#61; 8.25 to 8.5. Taking into the account the considerable extent of the center of the quake and the area of occurrence of the tsunami, this estimates seems likely to be correct.\\r\\n</p><p>(above from reference #413)\\r\\n</p><p>April 25, 1845, 42 N, 146 E, magnitude 8.4, tsunami intensity 2, validity 4. <b>46 deaths</b>, 75 houses destroyed.

       "  'comments': 'About 15-20 minutes after the earthquake, at approximately 0215, a wave from the sea poured onto the Denby cannery but caused no damage. Fifteen minutes after the first wave a second wave moved in from the southwest with a height of 11 m. It destroyed the structures on the sandspit and in southwestern part of Ust&#39;-Kamchatsk, passed up the river to the Ozernaia tributary and heaped up fragments of buildings and ice in it. The Kamchatka River was opened about a km and a half above its mouth; a new mouth was formed alongside the former one. <p>The old Denby cannery and the storehouses with goods and products were destroyed and in part washed into the ocean. Eighteen men were killed. The building of the radio-station survived but it was crammed with chunks of ice. The new Denby cannery suffered only in part. Of six cutter belonging to the Denby firm, four were jammed in the ice of the Ozernaia channel and the two others were thrown ashore. </p><p>In the southwest part of Ust&#39;-Kamchatsk six dwellings and several storage sheds, ice-houses, and smokehouses were destroyed, nine houses were half destroyed, animals were killed, many nets, boats, clothes and domestic utensils were completely spoiled. The ebb and flow int he river continued for a considerable time. </p><p>At first there was no information concerning the fate of the Tsutsumi and Nichiro canneries (it was impossible to get to them as the water had poured out over the tundra and the snow was greatly thinned out). At one plant was seen a heap of wreckage, the other was covered with masses of ice. </p><p>On April 23 two Japanese, workers of the Tsutsumi cannery, came to Berezovy Yar. They had had to flee 2.5 km from the wave, which advanced with a great noise. They were saved only thanks to the fact that the wave was held back by the deep snow. Thereafter the Japanese wandered for eight days over the flooded tundra without food or sleep until they stumbled onto the settlement. </p><p>In summer it was found out that both factories were completely destroyed. On the whole, as Troshin and Diagliev indicate, the tsunami extended along the northwest coast of the Gulf of Kamchatka from Cape Shubert to Perevoloka [an extension of the Denby sandpit, it separates Lake Nerpich&#39;e from the Gulf of Kamchatka]. In the area of First Creek the wave had the greatest height. Wreckage from the Nichiro cannery was carried up the valley of that creek. One of the cannery&#39;s cutters was thrown across a low coastal terrace about 1 km. broad and dropped on a slope at a height of about 20 m. In the valley trees were torn up by the roots over a distance of 7-8 km. </p><p>On the banks of Second Creek the destruction was on a smaller scale. Here the wave extended not more than 4.5 km from the mouth. To the northeast of First Creek, inthe area of the Tsutsumi cannery, the wave passed to the north over the tundra only 4km, and Ust&#39;-Kamchats, which is 1 km from the shore of the sea, was affected only on the southwest. Farther east towards Perevoloka the wave was still smaller. The radio station and cannery No. 1 suffered only on the side facing the sea. At Perevoloka the wave was no bigger than a storm wave; drifting timbers and sea week were thrown up on shore 50-70 m. \\r\\n</p><p>Intense tsunamis spread, apparently, also in a southeast direction from the center of the earthquake. Thus, a wave about 4 m high lashed Bering I. </p><p>(above from reference #413)\\r\\n</p><p>April 13, 1923, 1530 GMT. A magnitude 7.2 earthquake off the east coast of Kamchatka, Russia, generated a 20-m tsunami that caused some damage there and in Korea.

The displaced bottom mass generated by the slump event would have provided the impulse for the observed wave. An eyewitness described the wave as moving northward from a point within the middle of the north Dead Sea basin. This evidence supports the interpretation that the wave was caused by the slumping rather than by an oscillation of the lake level-ie., a seiche. (reference #4705)',\n",

       "  'comments': '1932, June 22. There was a destructive earthquake at Colima, with numerous recurrent aftershocks. The associated tsunami was the most destructive of all those produced in the Mesoamerican Trench in this century, and destroyed the resort of Cuyutlan, Col. A 10 m wave caused the death of more than 75 people and more than 100 were injured. The extension of the horizontal inland flood was 1 km, and the water reached the railroad tracks. Material damages were estimated at beween 2 and 6 million pesos (3.65 pesos to the dollar). Hotels and private houses by the beach were totally destroyed. The main street lost all its cobblestones, and some people were buried in the sand. The sea avalanche rushed over the houses, invading the main street. The population ran for cover, but some persons were caught by the waves and disappeared in them, screaming in terror. Not a single house was left standing in a stretch 20 km long and 1 km wide. <p>A section of the railroad track between Cuyutlan and Manzanillo was obstructed by sand, trees and bushes dragged by the tsunami. This phenomenon hit a 25 km extension from Ventanas (Manzanillo), to Salinas de Guasango (Tecoman). In Tenancingo, the tsunami also caused some casualties. Cuyutlan was invaded by two tsunami waves of less intensity: one during the night of June 22nd, and the other shortly after nine o&#39;clock in the morning of the 23rd. That time, the water only reached the main square in the resort, approximately 500 m from the coast.

Andaman earthquake had a moment magnitude Mw 7.7 and was located at 12.1 N and 92.5 E (Bilham et al., 2005). A tsunami was triggered by this earthquake in the Bay of Bengal. Height of the tsunami was reported to be of the order of 0.75 to 1.25 meters. At the time no tidal gauge was in operation. Mathematical calculations suggest that the height could be of the order of l m. This tsunami was witnessed along the eastern coast of India. It is believed that nearly 5,000 people were killed by the tsunami on the east coast of India. Local newspapers are believed to have mistaken the deaths and damage to a storm surge, however, a search of meteorological records does not show any storm surge on that day on the Coromandel Coast (Murty, 1984). National dailies like the Times of India, which reported the quake&#39;s shaking effects, did not mention any deaths, either as a result of a storm surge or a tsunami. (reference #2771)</p><p>The most recent of the major earthquakes in the Andaman Islands preceding the 2004 rupture occurred in 1941, a year before Japanese occupation of the islands. The earthquake was described only after the Second World War Ghingran, 1953; Krishnan, 1953). Although the tsunami generated by the 1941 earthquake is stated to have caused much loss of life along the east coast of India (Murty and Rafiq, 1991), no official (or unofficial) account of the impact of the remote tsunami has been discovered. Jhingran describes the loss of low-lying western-facing forest cover on the Andamans, presumably by a tsunami, but mentions no loss of life. Eyewitness reports published informally by the Society of Andaman and Nicobar Ecology (SANE) following the 2004 earthquake add further details to the official 1941 accounts. The central watchtower of the cellular jail in Port Blair collapsed along with a hospital and other masonry structures. Eyewitnesses spoke of subsidence of Ross Island (as in the recent earthquake), requiring its abandonment in favor of the current mainland capital, Port Blair.

However, Ortiz and Bilham (2003) and Bilham et al. (2005) have failed to unravel any scientific or press evidence to support this assertion (in contrast, e.g., to the Car Nicobar event of 1881), casting strong doubt on its veracity: it is extremely unlikely that a 1-m tsunami would result in such a death toll. (reference #12507)</p><p>Finally, the 1941 earthquake in the Andaman often appears in lists of IOT, but we could find no direct observation of a tsunami associated with this event (e.g. Jhingran 1952, only reports ‘‘there is no doubt that extensive waves’’ impacted the Andamans). Murty and Rafiq (1991) claim this event killed 5000 people along the west coast of India, but neither our archive search nor that of Ortiz and Bilham (2003) were able to confirm this claim.

Between DIM and PAN, there were only reports of the sea level lowering, but no unusual increase in wave height or tsunami inundation. The reported tsunami at PAN and TAG could probably be due to possible island trapping effect. It is noted that most notable tsunami runup heights were concentrated along the southeastern portion of Bohol Island - including a report from Camiguin island (CAM) of 1.2m based on PHIVOLCS official logs and records at the Hibok-hibok Volcano Observatory. The measured tsunami runup heights had an average height of 1m which was not sufficient enough to cause much destruction. The horizontal tsunami inundation was variable but generally extended to a\\r\\nfew tens of meters from the shoreline. Fortunately, the local low tide at the time was low.

       "  'comments': '543, 40.3 N, 28 E, earthquake intensity 10.5. Many sources report a strong earthquake affecting the town of Cyzicus (Asia Minor), destroying the city. The date of occurrence is uncertain: some authors date the event in 542 B.C., others in 543 B.C. or in 544/545. According to Giudoboni, the description of anomalous sea behavior in Thrace is dated 544/545 B.C. In area of Odessos (today Varna), Dionisopolis (today Balchik) and Afrodision the sea went out of its coasts as far as 4000 steps (about 5.8 km) in the Thrace coast. Many people drowned. (ref. #4139) <p>542 (possibly 543, Sept. 6), winter. Region of the Sea of Marmara. An earthquake. Cyzicus was destroyed. In some places, the shore of Thrace was flooded for 3-4 km including Odessus, (i&#61;4). The sea returned to its normal state after many people were killed and much damage done. Waves were observed in Dionysioupolis, Aphrodesion, in the Gulf of Edremit, in Asia Minor where many towns were flooded. There exists no reliable information on the preceding earthquake, but values of its parameters are available: 40.3 N, 27.8 E, M &#61; 6.8. (ref #2130) </p><p>542 Winter. Sea of Marmara. Thracian Coasts and Gulf of Edremit. From Cedrinos we learn that in the reign of Justinianus the sea flooded the coasts of Thrace and that the cities of Odessa (Varna), Dionysioupolis, Aphrodesion and other towns in the gulf of Adramyttium were inundated. The sea in many places advanced four miles inland and after drowning many people and causing heavy damage to the land retired to its habitual places... Neither Cedrinos nor Glycas imply in any way that the inundation of the Thracian coasts was the result of an earthquake. We notice, however, that Theophanes and Cedrinos mention in this period an earthquake which devastated Kyzicos (Banderma) and damaged Constantinople. This earthquake can be easily placed in the beginning of Sept 542 AD. This inundation of Thracian and Aegean coasts shows quite clearly the characteristics of a seismic sea-wave. It does not seem improbable that the cause of this wave was in fact the earthquake at Kyzicos (Banderma). When these two events happen to be so closely spaced together. From the narrations of the writers in the Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae on earthquake events of the period, one feels inclined to go even further and suggest the earthquake at Constantinople of 542, that of Kyzikos and the seismic sea-wave that followed belong, if not to the same earthquake, but to the activation of the Marmara region. (ref #24) </p><p>544. Black Sea. A destructive sea wave in the Black Sea flooded the coast of Thrace, inundating Odessus (now Varna), Dionysopolis (now Balchik) and Aphrodisium by advancing 4 miles inland, drowning many people before retiring. This event is mentioned by Theophanes, who places it in a.M. 6037 (Sept 544 to Aug 545), or in the 18th year of Justinian (Cedr. CS 657), which commenced in April 544. He does not mention, however, whether this event was associated with an earthquake. (ref #9116) </p><p> Tsunami observed in the Kapidag Peninsula, Erdek, Bandirma. (ref #11164) </p><p> </p><blockquote><i>Ref #11868:</i></blockquote>  <p>A large earthquake occurring offshore of the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea, very likely produced a strong tsunami that inundated in three coastal zones, namely Odessus, today Varna; Dionysopolis, today Balchik; Aphrodisium, situated in the Thracian Peninsula at the Xeros (today Saros) Bay, Northeast Aegean Sea. It is reported that sea advanced on Thrace by 4 mi and covered the three territories. Many drowned in the waters. However, no further details available. It is puzzling how a single tsunami event was capable to inundate coastal zones in Bulgarian Black Sea and the same time Thracian coasts facing the North Aegean Sea. This tsunami event is a good example, which indicates several uncertainties that often arise from historical documentation of tsunamis.</p>',\n",

About the same time an earthquake shock was felt in Smyrna. The details of the effects of this earthquake on land and at sea are given in three separate reports made by captains arriving in Zante, which confirm that the shock was associated with a seismic sea wave.

There was an earthquake on Lifou Island, the largest of the Loyalty (Loyaute) Islands. The shocks weakened on the next day, but intensified again on the 30th. Many settlements were damaged. A high wave which followed the earthquake washed away three settlements, and their residents for the most part perished. Off Aneityum Island, two sand banks more than 4 m high on the outer side of a reef were washed away; they later reformed. The wave flooded a number of other low-lying islands of the archipelago. \\r\\n</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Reference #79:</i></blockquote> \\r\\n<p>1875, March 28.

The testimonies and letters are reported in extenso by Louat (Louat, 1988) and Loua and Baldassari (Louat and Baldassari, 1989). The oral transmission of events gives evidence even today of some areas reached by the waves. A minimal runup of 2.5 m is reported in Mou by four descendants of different families affected by the tsunami (Ephrem N., 87 y.o., Andre L., 50, Jules H., 73, and the Lossi tribal area&#39;s High Chief, Evanesie Boula, ~50).

       "  'comments': 'On March 6, 1895, at 6:35 p.m. [local time] when anchored in the Trobriand Group off the small island of Yaga; latitude 8<sup>o</sup> 32.5&#39;S, longitude 151<sup>o</sup> 02.5&#39;E, the shock of an earthquake was felt. The ship heaved and trembled for over a minute. The motion was slight but marked, and was very like the motion imparted to the ship by the action of the screw when it is reversed and the fore part of the ship is aground. So far as I saw, the shock did not affect the surface of the sea near the vessel. <p>On our arrival at Kavatari next morning we found that the earthquake had been felt on shore at that place. It had caused the trees to sway and a cavity had been formed near the village. The cavity, a few yards in diameter and about four feet deep at its deepest part, had apparently been due to the giving way of the covering of an underground hollow.\\r\\n</p><p>On the following day we reached the island of Sim-Sim and learned that earthquake shocks had been felt in the evening of March 6th, and that the island had also suffered from a wave of the sea. The account given us by a native of the earthquake and the wave was this: A little after sunset they experienced a shock, then followed a loud booming sound apparently not very far off, then another shock. After this there was a lull for a short time, and then they heard the noise of the advancing wave, which almost immediately afterwards swept over the flat. The waters knocked the frail native houses down and swept portions of them, together with household goods, into the sea. <b>One little child was drowned</b>, and one man we saw that received some severe abrasions of the skin. \\r\\n</p><p>A native of Buna village, says that &#39;about 11 years ago (1895) the water came up in the same way but very much higher, and he gave me the <b>names of 26 people of Buna who lost their lives</b>. A report states &#39;My information indicates that it was a true earthquake-induced tidal wave or tsunami - the sea receded some distance before the wave came in. The wave traveled inland some 4 miles south to about the area of Ononda. I interviewed MacKenzie on 14.9.71. He was not able to tell me a lot except that his father was a small boy at the time, and that the <b>wave was probably about 20 ft high</b> and it had left Nixon in some thorn bushes.&#39; </p><p>When we reached Cape Vogel on March 21, we learned from the natives there that a short time back a great wave had struck the shore, apparently in Porlock Bay. News of the catastrophe had come down the coast to Cape Vogel. The natives could not give the date, but the time they gave was a little after dark, which corresponds with the time the water swept on Sim-Sim. The natives said that <b>four small villages in Porlock Bay which are close to each other were washed away and some people drowned</b>. \\r\\n</p><p>(above from reference #99)\\r\\n</p><p>Reports indicate that the tsunami was very localised and/or directional, the water receded first then returned as a 6m high tsunami at Sim-Sim yet no impact was observed on Kawa only 20km away. A \\x91great wave&#39; was reported in Porlock Bay on the Papuan Peninsula west of the Trobriand\\r\\nIslands where four villages were washed away, some of the villagers drowned. At Buna it is reported that 26 people drowned (Everingham, 1977). We have assumed the tsunami height there was 3 to 5m to cause the damage reported. At Simbang (near Finschhafen) the detailed sea-level observations made by missionary J. G. Pfalzer describe a typical tsunami with run-up of about 1m. (reference #11522)</p>',\n",
